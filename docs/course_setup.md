# Course Setup

This section breaks down precisely what must be done each semester to get a new instance running.

## 1 - Prepare Canvas

- [ ] Crosslist any additional sections: If you are teaching more than one section, we recommend you cross-list them so that you only need to be editing one course instance. [Instructions are provided](https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-10885-4214719646) by Canvas.

- [ ] Import most recent version of canvas course

- [ ] Fix LTI configurations (update visibility to be public, fix shared secret and key)

	- [ ] BlockPy: Consumer key and shared secret are [here](https://think.cs.vt.edu/courses/add_canvas). No further configuration is necessary if you are leaving the assignments unchanged.

	- [ ] Web-CAT: You will need to contact the Web-CAT admins to get your course set up on the Web-CAT system. Instructions for pairing assignments are given [here](http://web-cat.org/wiki/lti-configuration-instructions). If you have taught the course previously, you should be able to reuse the assignments from previous semesters; otherwise you will need to configure the assignments yourself with the provided unit tests.

- [ ] Setup Piazza (visit the Piazza tab and step through the options)

- [ ] Update Syllabus with most recent information

- [ ] Establish Open/Due/Lock Dates: 

## 2 - Organize Course Staff

- [ ] Send introductory email

- [ ] Arrange weekly staff meeting

- [ ] Arrange office hours

- [ ] Enroll TAs in Canvas course
