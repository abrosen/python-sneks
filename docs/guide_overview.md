# Introduction

Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the world, thanks to its power and ease of use. These features make it a great language to teach novice programmers, making it simple to pick up while still empowering students to solve real-world problems.

This course is designed with a broad population of learners in mind, aiming to get them programming and building software. Ideally, they will become more than just programmers - they will learn some enduring software development skills that they can transfer to other languages. However, this course is not expected to make them expert developers, but instead to make them competent at solving relatively small, well-defined problems in Python.

## Problem-Solving vs. Skill Development

This curriculum is built on the theory that students learn problem solving first by acquiring basic skills, and only then tackling more open-ended problems.
