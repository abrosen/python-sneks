    * Grade Python Installation activity

    * First project this week

        * Any problems encountered by the TAs when trying the project?

* Submit TA Feedback Report on Friday

    * Summarizes what has gone well, what has not

    * Your chance to help us redevelop the course.

* Looking forward:

    * Debugging - Problem-solving strategies (wolf-fence, rubber ducks, scientific method)

    * Defining functions - syntax, basic idea and metaphor

    * Unit testing - How we determine if functions are correct

    * Return vs. Print - The difference between them

    * Scope - Variables defined inside a function cannot be used outside of it, and vice versa.

    * Ethics Activity 1: Prompt on Net Neutrality. Make sure you read over the assignment instructions and its guide. TAs are responsible for using the Rubric when grading, and you must never assign points without using the rubric. Make sure you are using the interface to grade, not assigning points randomly.

* TA Training: "How People Learn"

    * Learning Styles: The DEBUNKED theory that teaching students according to their preferred style ("auditory", "visual", "kinestic") will improve their learning. Multiple peer reviewed studies suggest this is not the case.

    * Cognitive Load Theory: A collection of useful, well-studied theories and effects that break down how people absorb information.

        * [Dual-Channel Theory](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Cognitive_Theory_of_Multimedia_Learning) suggests that people learn better when multiple modalities are engaged (so talking as you write on the board, or having a text annotation on an image, is better than not). 

        * Every lesson has an Intrinsic load (necessary to complete the task), an Extraneous load (unrelated to the task), and Germane load (necessary for the learning). For example, a problem that has you tracing a FOR loop to process a list of prices requires:

            * Keeping the list of numbers in your head (intrinsic)

            * Knowing how to process a FOR loop (germane)

            * Ignoring the fact that these are prices (extraneous)

Your job as a TA is to manage student's extraneous load and avoid letting them be distracted. A common source of distraction is stress, which can be contagious, so keep your own stress levels down.

    * [Bloom's Taxonomy](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/59/Blooms-Taxonomy-650x366.jpg): Knowledge can be categorized at different levels, which build on each other. Knowing where on the taxonomy a student is struggling (e.g., with remembering terminology, or applying a rule, or being creative) can help diagnose their misunderstanding.

    * MUSIC Model of Academic motivation: The drive and energy to complete academic tasks can come from 5 sources:

        * eMpowerment: agency and freedom to explore and direct their learning. As a TA, you have minimal power here, but finding opportunities to empower students is good ("Did you know you can change the color of the turtle's line?").

        * Usefulness: the sense of long-term and short-term benefit of learning the material. Connecting a lesson or the class goals with students' individual goals will help support them.

        * Success: the self-efficacy, or belief by the students that they can complete tasks. Programming is often hard, so helping students manage their struggle is important. Express confidence in their ability (when appropriate) to help students understand they can accomplish things given time and practice.

        * Caring: the belief that classmates, instructors, and TAs want them to succeed. Simply letting students know you're available and want to help them is a good thing.

    * [Gagne's Nine Events](http://s4.thingpic.com/images/j7/uS44Q1YxM1NADqN1c4tP6izj.png): An instructional model for designing a lesson. Making sure you hit all these elements can ensure learning in a more systematic way. In general, make sure that each lesson is a combination of Presentation of content, Participation by the student, and Feedback from the TA.

### #15) Lesson: Strings

Summary: You should now feel comfortable with representing a string in your computer, and then manipulating them.

Learning objectives:

* Define the concept of a string

* Create a string literal

* Create a triple-quoted string

* Incorporate escape characters into a string

Activities:

* #15) Quiz: Strings

* #15) Programming: Strings

Misconceptions:

* Students often think that strings with numbers are actually integers.

* Students sometimes confuse variables and strings.

### #16) Lesson: String Operations

Summary: Strings can be manipulated according to their own rules and operations, distinct from integers and booleans.

Learning objectives:

* Combine string expressions

* Compare two strings

* Subscripting a character from a string

* Subscripting a range of characters from a string

* Using implicit indices to access string elements

* Using negative indices to access string elements

Activities:

* #16) Quiz: String Operations

* #16) Programming: String Operations

Misconceptions: *None identified so far*

### #17) Lesson: Calling Functions

Summary: Functions are a fundamental unit of programs, which we can use to break down tasks. Functions take in arguments and return data, just like programs. Functions are a powerful way for programmers to share code with each other, too. Some functions are known as methods, and are strongly associated with a value.

Learning objectives:

* Define the term Function

* Identify the necessary and optional parts of a Function call

* Explain the purpose of a Function

* Compare and contrast a function with a program

* Call a function with a return value

* Call a method with a return value

* Call a function with an argument

* Call a method with an argument

* Compare and contrast printing vs. returning from a function

Activities:

* #17) Quiz: Calling Functions

* #17) Programming: Calling Functions

Misconceptions:

* They believe that print is a part of a function call

* They believe that print is a statement rather than a function itself

### #18) Lesson: Calling Functions 2

Summary: Python comes with a huge number of built-in functions and methods. Programmers learn how to use these by referring to documentation. In practice, functions are often called in combination with other functions, methods, and operations.

Learning objectives:

* Interpret documentation for a function

* Use a function based on its documentation

* Distinguish between Parameters and Arguments

* Nest a function call inside another function call

* Chain a method onto another method

* Combine functions, methods, and operators into a complex expression

Activities:

* #18) Quiz: Calling Functions 2

* #18) Programming: Calling Functions 2

Misconceptions: *None identified so far*

Project 1: Turtle Art

Summary: Students create a work of art using the built-in Turtle graphics module. Turtle graphics are an easy way to draw images in Python by moving a virtual turtle around the screen (turtle.forward, turtle.right, turtle.left, etc.). 

Learning Objectives:

* Download and modify starting code

* Submit a working .PY file

* Write a longer (>20 lines) program

* Call methods to accomplish a task

* Be creative

* Have fun

Misconceptions:

* After uploading their completed program, students redownload the file and attempt to open it. Their systems are not properly configured to open the file, and instead it runs. This prevents them from seeing the actual code. You will need to explain what code is and how they can open it in Spyder or their code editor.

            * Did not draw a black border? No points.

            * Uploaded code as a screenshot? No points.

            * Uploaded code in a word doc? No points.

            * Drew a single line and gave up? No points.

    * TA Feedback Report was due on Friday

* Ethics Activity

    * Read the assignment description

    * Read the guide

    * Prompt: Net Neutrality

    * Demonstration of grading assignment through Canvas.

        * ASSIGN POINTS THROUGH THE RUBRIC, NOT AT RANDOM

* Project 2: Magical Banking

    * Context: writing an app to approve or reject loans for a magical bank

    * Need to integrate weird code from a grumpy co-worker, without touching it.

    * Main goal is to learn about program flow and satisfying unit tests

    * Write a function that calls several other functions, and also define those functions

    * Each function is individually very simple, but the combination of all of them will be challenging for some students who have not incorporated these ideas.

    * Difficulty level is higher than last project, hopefully around a 2-4 hour project for most students.

    * Expect many students to ignore the unit tests

    * Added problem: students will be using web-cat for the first time.

    * You'll need to try it out and complete it yourselves

    * Monday Class:

        * Room organized into color groups using construction paper

        * Start with brief lecture highlighting project components

        * Students are encouraged to work together on handout assignment (function tables) and the first two functions (print_introduction and input_name)

        * Also have a reference sheet with info about reading output diffs

        * Your role: mark down who completed the assignment (you'll have a spreadsheet of names), make sure they have completed it correctly -> simpler if they work together and you can grade multiple at the same time.

        * Answer questions, but try to answer groups instead of individuals - steer people towards their peers

        * Each TA will have their own color that they're responsible for (about 20-30 students each). One TA will be a Meta TA walking around helping out as needed

        * Goal: get them started on the project, via fostering community

* Looking forward:

    * Documenting - Writing comments and multi-line comments

    * Function Development - creating more complex functions, particularly by extracting repeated code

    * Data Flow - seeing how values flow through a program

* TA Training: Problem Students I

    * "You are a Teaching assistant, not a Passing assistant".

    * 3.1 Students who want the answer, not learning

        * Ask questions

        * Solve in a different context

        * Make them do something before going on

        * Look at them, not the computer

        * Say "no"

        * Avoid becoming an oracle

        * https://www.cs.virginia.edu/luther/ta-training/students.html#students-who-want-the-answer-not-learning

    * 3.2 Students whose question is answered in the assignment writeup

        * Ask them "Please go to the assignment writeup. Read it aloud to me."

        * https://www.cs.virginia.edu/luther/ta-training/students.html#students-whose-question-is-answered-in-the-assignment-writeup

    * 3.3 Students who insist on doing it the wrong way

        * Neither force nor ignore

        * Give them a choice, "I can provide excellent help with a better approach, or vague help with your current approach."

        * https://www.cs.virginia.edu/luther/ta-training/students.html#students-who-insist-on-doing-it-the-wrong-way

    * 3.5 Students who seem not to have attended class or read the textbook

        * If you have tons of time, you can teach them

        * But otherwise, redirect them to the course resources (book, slides, google)

        * If they refuse, then you can refuse to help them.

        * https://www.cs.virginia.edu/luther/ta-training/students.html#students-who-seem-not-to-have-attended-class-or-read-the-textbook

* Students attempt to add "types" to the arguments by surrounding the parameter names with quotes, square brackets, and other literal symbols.

* Students attempt to nest function definitions into other control structures

* Students print instead of using return

### #21) Lesson: Unit Tests

Summary: Unit tests are used to ensure that a function is correct.

Learning objectives:

* Explain how functions are tested for correctness.

* List advantages of using unit tests

* Intepret a failing unit test

* Describe the limitations of unit tests

Activities:

* #21) Quiz: Unit Tests

Misconceptions: *None identified so far* 

### #22) Lesson: Return and Print

Summary: Returning from a function causes a value to be made available at the callsite. Printing from a function makes a value appear on the console.

Learning objectives:

* Differentiate between a return statement and a print function

* Identify the output of a function that does not return anything

* Identify the output of a function that prints instead of returns

* Identify a callsite

Activities:

* #22) Quiz: Return and Print
