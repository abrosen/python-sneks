# Module 0 - Getting Started

A gentle orientation to the basic ideas of a program, plus the format of the course, help-seeking behavior, and how to be an effective learner.

### Before the week begins

* Read over this document
* Check out your classroom to make sure it fits the requirements

### Major Topics

* Basics of programs, programming, programming languages, and computing in general

* Basic idea of execution

* How to be a good learner (working early/often, misconceptions about learning CS like learning styles)

* Help-seeking behavior (i.e. how to ask for help)

* Installation of Anaconda and a Text Editor locally

* Trying out BlockPy

### Materials

## Module 0 - Staff Meeting

Agenda:

* Everyone introduce (name, section, prof/GTA/UTA, year, major)

    * "I'm Dr. Bart, I'm the professor of the MWF section, this is my second year teaching, and I'm a professor in Computer Science"

* Resolve practical questions

* Assign TA homework

* Review course format (refer to the first chapter of this document)

    * How modules work, how lessons work

* Review course topics (refer to the first chapter of this document)

* Explain TA policies (refer to policy document on Google Drive)

* First activity for grading "Python Installation"

Things to Resolve:

* Who's attending which class

Training Materials:

* For now, think about what makes a good or bad TA, write some things down.

* Next week, we'll start talking about Ethics in TAing.

## Lessons

### Lesson 1- Introduction 

Summary: Programs are created by programmers to give computers instructions. Data comes in, the computer processes it, and then returns the result to the user. 

Learning Objectives:
* Describe major course concepts and policies
* Use the Canvas site to access course materials
* Define "programming"
* Explain why programming is useful
* Identify limitations of programming
* Enumerate the core components of programs
* Write simple programs

Activities:
* Lesson: Introduction
* Quiz: Introduction
* Programming: Maze Game

Misconceptions:
* {"Maze 10 is tricky. Can be useful to remind students that their answer may not guide their avatar to the goal directly. Also helps to explain the Left-hand-on-wall rule (which doesn't require a particular maze)": 'if there is a path to the left, go left; otherwise, if there is a path ahead, go ahead; otherwise go right.'}
* Some students fail to see how they need to place blocks WITHIN the [repeat] block in order to have commands execute repeatedly. Explaining the code aloud seems to help.

### Lesson 2- Languages 

Summary: Programs are written by programmers using programming languages such as Python. 

Learning Objectives:
* Define the term "programming language"
* Describe the difference between syntax, grammar, and semantics
* Explain the meaning of the terms "run" and "execute".
* Install Python on your laptop.
* Use BlockPy to run a program.

Activities:
* Lesson: Languages
* Quiz: Languages
* Programming: Python Installation

Misconceptions:
* Students do not follow the instructions very closely.

### Lesson 3- Execution 

Summary: A written program can be executed. 

Learning Objectives:
* Explain the meaning of the terms "run" and "execute".
* Use BlockPy to run a program.

Activities:
* Lesson: Execution
* Quiz: Execution
* Programming: Try BlockPy

Misconceptions: _None listed so far_

### Lesson 4- How to Learn 

Summary: To succeed in this course, you should start early, work often, and manage your time. 

Learning Objectives:
* List common misconceptions about learning.
* List best strategies for learning to program.
* Assess prior knowledge of programming

Activities:
* Lesson: How to Learn
* Quiz: How to Learn

Misconceptions: _None listed so far_

### Lesson 5- Getting Help 

Summary: When you seek help, make sure you communicate in a professional way. 

Learning Objectives:
* Seek help by communicating desired functionality, approach, perceived problems, current code, and specific errors.

Activities:
* Lesson: Getting Help
* Quiz: Getting Help

Misconceptions: _None listed so far_
