### Lesson 1- Introduction 

Summary: Programs are created by programmers to give computers instructions. Data comes in, the computer processes it, and then returns the result to the user. 

Learning Objectives:
* Describe major course concepts and policies
* Use the Canvas site to access course materials
* Define "programming"
* Explain why programming is useful
* Identify limitations of programming
* Enumerate the core components of programs
* Write simple programs

Activities:
* Lesson: Introduction
* Quiz: Introduction
* Programming: Maze Game

Misconceptions:
* {"Maze 10 is tricky. Can be useful to remind students that their answer may not guide their avatar to the goal directly. Also helps to explain the Left-hand-on-wall rule (which doesn't require a particular maze)": 'if there is a path to the left, go left; otherwise, if there is a path ahead, go ahead; otherwise go right.'}
* Some students fail to see how they need to place blocks WITHIN the [repeat] block in order to have commands execute repeatedly. Explaining the code aloud seems to help.

### Lesson 2- Languages 

Summary: Programs are written by programmers using programming languages such as Python. 

Learning Objectives:
* Define the term "programming language"
* Describe the difference between syntax, grammar, and semantics
* Explain the meaning of the terms "run" and "execute".
* Install Python on your laptop.
* Use BlockPy to run a program.

Activities:
* Lesson: Languages
* Quiz: Languages
* Programming: Python Installation

Misconceptions:
* Students do not follow the instructions very closely.

### Lesson 3- Execution 

Summary: A written program can be executed. 

Learning Objectives:
* Explain the meaning of the terms "run" and "execute".
* Use BlockPy to run a program.

Activities:
* Lesson: Execution
* Quiz: Execution
* Programming: Try BlockPy

Misconceptions: _None listed so far_

### Lesson 4- How to Learn 

Summary: To succeed in this course, you should start early, work often, and manage your time. 

Learning Objectives:
* List common misconceptions about learning.
* List best strategies for learning to program.
* Assess prior knowledge of programming

Activities:
* Lesson: How to Learn
* Quiz: How to Learn

Misconceptions: _None listed so far_

### Lesson 5- Getting Help 

Summary: When you seek help, make sure you communicate in a professional way. 

Learning Objectives:
* Seek help by communicating desired functionality, approach, perceived problems, current code, and specific errors.

Activities:
* Lesson: Getting Help
* Quiz: Getting Help
