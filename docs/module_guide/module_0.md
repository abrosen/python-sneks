## Module 0 - Getting Started

A gentle orientation to the basic ideas of a program, plus the format of the course, help-seeking behavior, and how to be an effective learner.

Before the week begins:

* Read over this document

* Check out your classroom to make sure it fits the requirements

Topics:

* Basics of programs, programming, programming languages, and computing in general

* Basic idea of execution

* How to be a good learner (working early/often, misconceptions about learning CS like learning styles)

* Help-seeking behavior (i.e. how to ask for help)

* Installation of Anaconda and a Text Editor locally

* Trying out BlockPy

Materials: 

* week0_day1_Introduction.pptx

* week0_day2_Python.pptx

Things to do after class: N/A

### Week 0 - Staff Meeting

Agenda:

* Everyone introduce (name, section, prof/GTA/UTA, year, major)

    * "I'm Dr. Bart, I'm the professor of the MWF section, this is my second year teaching, and I'm a professor in Computer Science"

* Resolve practical questions

* Assign TA homework

* Review course format (refer to the first chapter of this document)

    * How modules work, how lessons work

* Review course topics (refer to the first chapter of this document)

* Explain TA policies (refer to policy document on Google Drive)

* First activity for grading "Python Installation"

Things to Resolve:

* Who's attending which class

Training Materials:

* For now, think about what makes a good or bad TA, write some things down.

* Next week, we'll start talking about Ethics in TAing.

### #1) Lesson: Introduction

Summary: In this lesson, you'll learn the basics of programs and programming. You'll get a chance to write some short programs to escape a maze. In class, we'll learn more about the course and your instructors.

Learning Objectives:

* Describe major course concepts and policies

* Use the Canvas site to access course materials

* Define "programming"

* Explain why programming is useful

* Identify limitations of programming

* Enumerate the core components of programs

* Write simple programs

Activities:

* Quiz

* Maze game

Misconceptions:

* Maze 10 is tricky. Can be useful to remind students that their answer may not guide their avatar to the goal directly, they may take some wrong turns along the way. Also helps to explain the Left-hand-on-wall rule (which doesn't require a particular maze):

    * if there is a path to the left, go left;

    * otherwise, if there is a path ahead, move forward;

    * otherwise turn right.

Note that the wording here is significant (going left means turn AND move).

* Some students fail to see how they need to place blocks WITHIN the [repeat] block in order to have commands execute repeatedly. Explaining the code aloud seems to help.

* Some students "succeed" in a level, but it doesn't register as finished. The problem is that they ran into the wall, and it won't count that as success (even though they're at the marker). Typically, their code will be a convoluted mess to accomplish this, so I tell them that they should find a simpler solution, and give them a hint: there's only two if or if/else blocks needed. But in some cases, it's just because they ran into a wall - the developers of the maze felt that you had to LAND on the solution, not just touch it and move on.

* Some students might fail to notice the new blocks when they are available (e.g., the if/else blocks in addition to the if/then).

### #2) Lesson: Languages

Summary: In today's lesson, you'll learn some fundamental terminology about programs. You will also be installing Python.

Learning Objectives:

* Define the term "programming language"

* Describe the difference between syntax, grammar, and semantics

* Explain the meaning of the terms "run" and "execute".

* Install Python on your laptop.

* Use BlockPy to run a program.

Activities:

* Quiz

* Python Installation

Misconceptions:

* Students do not follow the instructions very closely. They'll think they know what to do for submitting, and leave things out. Refer them to the instructions wherever possible.

* There are always installation issues with Anaconda - either because of technical failures or because of student mistakes. Start writing down common problems and solutions and sharing them among the course staff.

* Some students think "Day 2 == Lesson 2" and that's it. They don't realize they should keep going with the material.

### #3) Lesson: Execution

Summary: In today's lesson, you'll learn how we use programs by running them. You will also be trying BlockPy.

Learning Objectives:

* Explain the meaning of the terms "run" and "execute".

* Use BlockPy to run a program.

Activities:

* Quiz

* Try BlockPy (just one quick question)

Misconceptions: N/A

### #4) Lesson: How to Learn

Summary: In today's class, you'll learn about how to be a good learner in this course.

Learning Objectives:

* List common misconceptions about learning.

* List best strategies for learning to program.

* Assess prior knowledge of programming

Activities:

* Quiz

Misconceptions: N/A

### #5) Lesson: Getting Help

Summary: In this lesson, you will learn how to correctly ask for help.

Learning Objectives:

* Seek help by communicating desired functionality, approach, perceived problems, current code, and specific errors.

Activities:

* Quiz

Misconceptions: N/A
