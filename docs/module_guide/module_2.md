### Lesson 14- Error Messages 

Summary: When Python encounters a problem in your program, it raises an error message. This error message can be read to better understand what went wrong with your program. 

Learning Objectives:
* Explain an error message for different types of errors
* Recall the similarity in the terms "Error" and "Exception"
* Track down the offending line of an error message
* Choose an appropriate solution to the error message
* Track down the offending line of an error message in a called function of an external module

Activities:
* Lesson: Errors
* Quiz: Errors
* Programming: Errors

Misconceptions: _None listed so far_

### Lesson 15- String Operations 

Summary: You should now feel comfortable with representing a string in your computer, and then manipulating them. 

Learning Objectives:
* Define the concept of a string
* Create a string literal
* Create a triple-quoted string
* Incorporate escape characters into a string

Activities:
* Lesson: Strings
* Quiz: Strings
* Programming: Strings

Misconceptions:
* Students often think that strings with numbers are actually integers.
* Students sometimes confuse variables and strings.

### Lesson 16- String Operations 

Summary: Strings can be manipulated according to their own rules and operations, distinct from integers and booleans. 

Learning Objectives:
* Combine two strings
* Compare two strings
* Subscripting a character from a string
* Subscripting a range of characters from a string

Activities:
* Lesson: String Operations
* Quiz: String Operations
* Programming: String Operations

Misconceptions: _None listed so far_

### Lesson 17- Calling Functions 

Summary: Functions are a fundamental unit of programs, which we can use to break down tasks. Functions take in arguments and return data, just like programs. Functions are a powerful way for programmers to share code with each other, too. Some functions are known as methods, and are strongly associated with a value. 

Learning Objectives:
* Define the term Function
* Identify the necessary and optional parts of a Function call
* Explain the purpose of a Function
* Compare and contrast a function with a program
* Call a function with a return value
* Call a method with a return value
* Call a function with an argument
* Call a method with an argument
* Compare and contrast printing vs. returning from a function

Activities:
* Lesson: Calling Functions
* Quiz: Calling Functions
* Programming: Calling Functions

Misconceptions:
* They believe that print is a part of a function call
* They believe that print is a statement rather than a function itself

### Lesson 18- Calling Functions 2 

Summary: Python comes with a huge number of built-in functions and methods. Programmers learn how to use these by referring to documentation. In practice, functions are often called in combination with other functions, methods, and operations. 

Learning Objectives:
* Interpret documentation for a function
* Use a function based on its documentation
* Distinguish between Parameters and Arguments
* Nest a function call inside another function call
* Chain a method onto another method
* Combine functions, methods, and operators into a complex expression

Activities:
* Lesson: Calling Functions 2
* Quiz: Calling Functions 2
* Programming: Calling Functions 2
