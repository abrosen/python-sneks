### Lesson 19- Debugging Techniques 

Summary: When you encounter an error, you should attempt to debug them (using print statements, meticulously explaining your code, etc.). 

Learning Objectives:
* Choose the most suitable debugging method to debug a program
* Compare and contrast different debugging techniques
* Explain how you can use automatic tracing tools to debug a program
* Explain how you can use print debugging to debug a program
* Explain how you can use code tracing to debug a program
* Explain how you can google to debug a program
* Explain how you can use rubber duck debugging

Activities:
* Lesson: Debugging
* Quiz: Debugging

### Lesson 20- Defining Functions 

Summary: Function definitions have a body of code and are described by their header. Creating functions is necessary for building up programs of scale. 

Learning Objectives:
* Determine if a situation could benefit from a function
* Break down a complex task into multiple function calls
* Identify the scope of variables in and outside of a function
* Define a function with a return value
* Describe the difference between parameters and arguments
* Define a function without parameters
* Define a function with parameters
* Extract a variable from a function into a parameter
* Describe the signature of a function

Activities:
* Lesson: Defining Functions
* Quiz: Defining Functions
* Programming: Defining Functions

Misconceptions:
* Students believe that any code should be encapsulated in a function, instead of code that needs to be reused or worked on in isolation.
* Students attempt to add "types" to the arguments by surrounding the parameter names with quotes, square brackets, and other literal symbols.
* Students attempt to nest function definitions into other control structures
* Students print instead of using return

### Lesson 21- Unit Tests 

Summary: Unit tests are used to ensure that a function is correct. 

Learning Objectives:
* Explain how functions are tested for correctness.
* List advantages of using unit tests
* Intepret a failing unit test
* Describe the limitations of unit tests

Activities:
* Lesson: Unit Tests
* Quiz: Unit Tests

### Lesson 22- Return and Print 

Summary: Returning from a function causes a value to be made available at the callsite. Printing from a function makes a value appear on the console. 

Learning Objectives:
* Differentiate between a return statement and a print function
* Identify the output of a function that does not return anything
* Identify the output of a function that prints instead of returns
* Identify a callsite

Activities:
* Lesson: Return and Print
* Quiz: Return and Print

### Lesson 23- Scope 

Summary: Variables created inside a function cannot be used outside the function, and variables created outside a function should not be used within. 

Learning Objectives:
* Determine whether a variable is available within a function.
* Determine whether a variable is available outside a function.
* Determine whether a variable is aliased within a function.
* Define the difference between a global variable and a local variable.
* Explain why global variables are bad.

Activities:
* Lesson: Scope
* Quiz: Scope

### Lesson 24- Documenting 

Summary: Documentation is a helpful tool for the benefit of programmers to better organize code. There are several ways to document in Python, but typically functions are documented using multi-line comments that describe the function's inputs, outputs, and purpose. 

Learning Objectives:
* Create a single-line comment
* Create a multi-line comment
* Differentiate between a single- and multi- line comment
* Explain the limitation of multi-line comments
* Explain the purpose of documentation
* Document a function's inputs, outputs, and purpose

Activities:
* Lesson: Documenting
* Quiz: Documenting

### Lesson 25- Function Development 

Summary: Functions allow us to extract commonly repeated chunks of code. 

Learning Objectives:
* Use functions to solve problems
* Evaluate the name of a function
* Extract code into a function
* Define functional decomposition

Activities:
* Lesson: Function Development
* Quiz: Function Development
* Programming: Function Development

### Lesson 26- Data Flow 

Summary: Data enters a function through parameters and leaves through returns. To make data available between functions, it will need to be returned. 

Learning Objectives:
* Describe how data flows between two chained functions.
* Explain how values defined in one function can flow to another function.
* Describe how user input introduces new values

Activities:
* Lesson: Data Flow
* Quiz: Data Flow
