### Lesson 32- For Loops 

Summary: The FOR loop performs a body of actions on each element of a list, one at a time. The body is written to perform the action on a generic iteration variable that represents each of the elements of the list. 

Learning Objectives:
* Define a For Loop and Iteration Variable for an Iteration List
* Construct an Iteration Variable for an Iteration List
* Write code that involves iteration over a list value
* Write code that involves iteration over a list variable
* Identify the type of the iteration variable with respect to the iteration list
* Determine if a situation requires a For loop

Activities:
* Lesson: For Loops
* Quiz: For Loops
* Programming: For Loops

### Lesson 33- Loop Patterns 

Summary: FOR loops are usually used in a few recurring patterns that are useful to memorize. 

Learning Objectives:
* List the common patterns associated with FOR loops
* Match a problem with the associated loop pattern
* Use the Map pattern of FOR loops to transform a list
* Use the Filter pattern of FOR loops to remove elements from a list
* Use the Sum pattern of FOR loops to summate a list of integers
* Use the Count pattern of FOR loops to count the length of a list
* Use the Accumualte pattern of FOR loops to combine elements of a list
* Use the Min/Max pattern of FOR loops to find the highest or lowest element of a list
* Modify a loop pattern to solve a problem

Activities:
* Lesson: Loop Patterns
* Quiz: Loop Patterns
* Programming: Loop Patterns

### Lesson 34- Mutability 

Summary: Lists can have their value changed, unlike other types of values like strings. 

Learning Objectives:
* Define the term Mutability
* Differentiate list appending from string addition
* Explain the result of assigning the result of list appending to the list variable

Activities:
* Lesson: Mutability
* Quiz: Mutability
