### Lesson 35- Lists and Strings 

Summary: FOR Loops are not just useful for lists - they can also be used with Strings and other sequence types. 

Learning Objectives:
* Iterate through a string
* Process a String with a FOR loop
* Differentiate between a list and a string

Activities:
* Lesson: Lists and Strings
* Quiz: Lists and Strings
* Programming: Lists and Strings

Misconceptions: _None listed so far_

### Lesson 36- Lists and Indexes 

Summary: Unlike other languages, Python is optimized to loop through values, not indexes. Indexes complicate the already complicated process of loops. 

Learning Objectives:
* Iterate through a list by its indexes
* Explain why you should avoid iterating by indexes

Activities:
* Lesson: Lists and Indexes
* Quiz: Lists and Indexes

Misconceptions: _None listed so far_

### Lesson 37- List Comprehensions 

Summary: List comprehensions are a type of expression similar to a FOR loop, but are explicitly for creating new lists. They are very convenient shorthand for creating lists. 

Learning Objectives:
* Create a list using a list comprehension
* Create a list using a list comprehension and filtering
* Identify the advantage of a list comprehension over other forms of list creation
* Identify the drawback of using a list comprehension over regular FOR loops.

Activities:
* Lesson: List Comprehensions
* Quiz: List Comprehensions
* Programming: List Comprehensions

Misconceptions: _None listed so far_

### Lesson 38- While Loops 

Summary: The WHILE loop repeatedly performs a body of actions until its condition is no longer true. In this way, they are very similar to an IF statement that loops back on itself. 

Learning Objectives:
* Compare and contrast the For loop and While loop
* Define a While loop
* Determine if a situation requires a While loop
* Write code that involves condition based iteration
* Define control structure
* Identify control structures in code
* Describe the impact of various control structures on the sequence of a program.
* Nest control structures

Activities:
* Lesson: While Loops
* Quiz: While Loops
* Programming: While Loops
