### Lesson 39- Dictionaries 

Summary: A dictionary maps keys to values. Looking up data in a dictionary is very fast and convenient. Keys and values in a dictionary can be set on the fly, which makes them an extremely powerful tool for solving many kinds of problems. 

Learning Objectives:
* Create a dictionary literal
* Describe the subtypes of a dictionary
* Iterate through a dictionary using .keys(), .values(), and .items()
* Use dictionary access to access a literal key
* Test membership within a dictionary

Activities:
* Lesson: Dictionaries
* Quiz: Dictionaries

Misconceptions:
* When students have confused a variables type and attempt to index it, they get a TypeError or KeyError that can be quite confusing.
* Students attempt to look up a key in a dictionary by iterating through it and testing each key.
