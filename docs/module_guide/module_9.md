### Lesson 44- Filesystems 

Summary: Your computer has a File System that allows you to navigate, open, and edit files. These files are organized so that programs can open them using their address. 

Learning Objectives:
* Navigate a file system using the command line
* Identify the path of a file

Activities:
* Lesson: Filesystem
* Quiz: Filesystem

Misconceptions: _None listed so far_

### Lesson 45- Files 

Summary: Once opened, data can be read from files in the program. 

Learning Objectives:
* Define the term File
* Explain the difference between a File and a String
* Properly open and close a file using the With block
* Differentiate between a File, it's name, it's path, and it's handle
* Read an entire file into memory
* Read a file using line by line iteration

Activities:
* Lesson: Files
* Quiz: Files
* Programming: Files

Misconceptions:
* Students get confused about the three ways to traverse a file (.read, .readlines, and using the file object as an iterator)

### Lesson 46- Modules 

Summary: Modules are a collection of functions and code that are shareable with other coders. Every time you create a Python program, you are actually creating a module. There are many modules out there. 

Learning Objectives:
* Define the term "Module"
* Write code that imports a module
* Write code that uses functions defined in an external module
* Create a module

Activities:
* Lesson: Modules
* Quiz: Modules
* Programming: Modules

Misconceptions:
* Students try to combine the two styles of importing in incorrect ways (e.g., after "import math" they write "log" instead of "math.log")

### Lesson 47- File Formats 

Summary: Files are often organized according to a particular format, which can make it much easier to access the data inside. 

Learning Objectives:
* Define the term "File Format"
* Compare and contrast the JSON format with a basic text format
* Use a named parameter to call a function

Activities:
* Lesson: File Formats
* Quiz: File Formats
* Programming: File Formats

Misconceptions: _None listed so far_

### Lesson 48- Web Data 

Summary: Requests is the name of a powerful module for quickly and easily retrieving data from the internet. Accessing web-based data is one of Python's great strengths and has many practical applications in real life. 

Learning Objectives:
* Retrieve structured data from a URL algorithmically using Requests
* Retrieve data from a web page algorithmically using Requests
* Extract data from an HTML page using BeautifulSoup
* Extract data from a string using Regexes
* Identify practical applications of downloading data from the internet
* List hazards of using data through the web.

Activities:
* Lesson: Web Data
* Quiz: Web Data
* Programming: Web Data

Misconceptions:
* Students attempt to use "open" to get access to data in URLs and use "requests" to get access to local data.
