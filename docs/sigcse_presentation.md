Problem
    Many students, few instructors
        Limited time
        Constantly (re)inventing curriculum
        Overworked instructors w/ inadequate curriculum
    Local VT context
        Need to redesign "Intro to Python for Engineers"
        200+ students in one section
        Often handed around among instructors
    "I should steal as much as I can"
        Not many public, open-source curricula for undergraduate instructors
            Existing Python courses (Big list of citations and links, connect to field guide)
            What's missing with these?
                Open Source
                Undergraduate Focus (audience and instructors)
                Modern Pedagogy (Take as given that you want)
            Heck, really the framework for what I want doesn't exist
Goal:
        Develop an Instructionally Designed, Open-Source, reusable intro to Python curriculum for undergraduates (particularly engineers)
    Meta Goal:
        Develop a process for designing such Curricular Materials (Hook for BOF)

Timeline of Work
    Summer 2017: Initial Development
    Fall 2017: First deployment
    Winter 2018: First revision
    Spring 2018: Second deployment (+1 instructor)
    Summer 2018: Second revision (minimal)
    Fall 2018: Third deployment (not me)
    Winter 2019: Material propogation

What is Instructional Design?
    1) Needs Analysis
        DFW Rate
        Student satisfaction
        Deployable, Reusable
        Python Knowledge
    2) Learner Analysis, Task Analysis
    3) Goals
        Learning Objectives listed
        Examples of 
    4) Assessments
        Quizzes
        Programming Problems
    5) Strategy
        Canvas, BlockPy, WebCAT
        Module is a composition of Lessons
        Take as a given
            Active learning
            Mastery-based
            Many Small Assignments
            Accessible videos
            Fun, Useful, Empowering

    6) Materials
        Slides, Videos
    7) Evaluations
        Surveys
        IRT/Classical Test Theory
        Staff Discussions
        Action Design Research

        Results: Mostly good!

Summary and What's next?
    We need to rethink Curriculum Development!
        Do you follow a formal process for developing your course?
        What evaluations do you run?
        What would happen if you got hit by a bus?
        What happens when you need to teach the course a second time, or hand it off to an adjunct? 
    Publicly releasing a course is hard
        It took so much time to develop everything
        Public/Private/Secret data and access requirements
        Plain text formats are helpful
        Forking/Joining
    Curriculum materials packaging Working Group
        Come to our BoF!
    Now teaching CS1 at UD, want to reshape the curriculum for that audience
    What about you?
        Come to the BoF
        Think of your courses
            Are they aligned with themselves?
            How reusable is it?
            How do you know if it's working?
            What would it take to package them?
            How could our Working Group help you?
