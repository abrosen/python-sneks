This document describes the terminology and concepts of this repository.

* Lesson: A combination of presentations and assessables intended for specific learning objectives. A lesson is either Asynchronous or Synchronous.
* Asynchronous: Student-mediated activities, such as pre-recorded video lessons.
* Synchronous: Instructor-mediated activities, such as in-class lectures.
* Assessable: Activities that can be assessed, particularly so that a grade or feedback could be given. The key component of an Assessable is that it ellicts a response from the student (as opposed to a Presentation) that needs to be captured. An interactive visualization would not be Assessable unless the students' interactions were being captured and graded.
* Presentation: Activities that give information to a student. These can be mediated by an instructor, but they could also be prerecorded or in text form. They are tied strongly to learning objectives, as opposed to being tied strongly to topics (which would be Information).
