title: Introduction
introduction: In this lesson, you'll learn the basics of programs and programming. You'll get a chance to write some short programs to escape a maze. In class, we'll learn more about the course and your instructors.

    The goal of the first class is to introduce yourself to students and orient them to the classes features. At the same time, they will also learn about the basics of programming. 
    
    The activity for the day is the maze game, where they guide an avatar through a maze. You'll want to try the maze yourself to make sure that you know how to solve them all (i.e. maze 10 is a little hard).
objectives:
    - Describe major course concepts and policies
    - Use the Canvas site to access course materials
    - Define "programming"
    - Explain why programming is useful
    - Identify limitations of programming
    - Enumerate the core components of programs
    - Write simple programs
activities:
    - "Lesson: Introduction"
    - "Quiz: Introduction"
    - Programming 1- Maze Game
summary: Programs are created by programmers to give computers instructions. Data comes in, the computer processes it, and then returns the result to the user.

misconceptions:
    - Maze 10 is tricky. Can be useful to remind students that their answer may not guide their avatar to the goal directly. Also helps to explain the Left-hand-on-wall rule (which doesn't require a particular maze): if there is a path to the left, go left; otherwise, if there is a path ahead, go ahead; otherwise go right.
    - Some students fail to see how they need to place blocks WITHIN the [repeat] block in order to have commands execute repeatedly. Explaining the code aloud seems to help.
