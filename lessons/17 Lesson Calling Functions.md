In this lesson, you will learn about how to use functions. Functions are a
fundamental element of programming that allow you to reuse code. Functions are
a complex tool, so we will learn more about them in the next lesson. When you
complete this one, you should feel free to continue directly onto the next
one!

**Slide 1 - Calling Functions:**  
Let's learn about Calling Functions.

**Slide 2 - What Are Functions?:**  
Functions are reusable chunks of code. Once code is wrapped in a function, we
can use it in other places. First, we'll learn how to use functions. Later,
we'll learn how to make them for ourselves.

**Slide 3 - Terminology:**  
When you want to "use" a Function, we say that you "call" it. Another term is
"invoking" a function.

**Slide 4 - Syntax:**  
There are two essential parts to calling a function: The name of the function,
and then parentheses following the name. These parentheses are CRITICAL to
calling the function.

**Slide 5 - Calling or Not:**  
To call a function, you MUST add parentheses. Otherwise, you are simply
referring to the name of the function rather than executing it. Think of it as
the difference between "talking about going to the store" as opposed to
"actually physically going to the store".

**Slide 6 - Functions vs. Programs:**  
A program and a function are similar, but not quite the same. They both have
the same "Input-Process-Output" pattern. However, functions are typically much
smaller, and are meant to accomplish a single specific task. In fact, most
industrial programs are actually just a bunch of functions working together!

**Slide 7 - Functions vs. Methods:**  
Methods are a special kind of function. They are attached strongly to a value.
The way we write a method call is slightly different too, since it needs to
incorporate that value.

**Slide 8 - Calling Methods:**  
When you want to use a Method, you need the name, parentheses, AND two more
pieces: The calling value or variable and a period. In later lessons, we'll
learn more about this strange syntax. For now, get comfortable with the
difference between calling functions and methods.

**Slide 9 - Metaphor:**  
You don't have to know *how* a function accomplishes its goal, in order to use
it. Think of it like a well-run office. When you ask an employee to complete
some work, you don't care how it happens, just the inputs and outputs to their
process. You give them the assignment and tell them what you need, and they
make it happen and get you back a report. This separation of concerns allows
you to focus on the big picture of a program without worrying about the minor
details.

**Slide 10 - Returning Values:**  
Functions are useful because they can return values. Functions can return any
type of value: String, Boolean, Integer, whatever you need. Mentally, when a
function is called, you can imagine the result replacing the entire function
call. In a way, this is similar to what happens when you do addition or
subtraction.

**Slide 11 - Arguments:**  
An important part of functions are "arguments". Arguments are values that are
given to functions that affect the behavior of the function. Arguments for a
function are placed inside the parentheses, and each one is separated by a
comma. We say that these arguments are being "passed" to the function.

**Slide 12 - Black Box:**  
Think of a function as a magic black box. You cannot see inside the box to
know how it works, but you do not need to. The arguments come in through a
funnel. Returned values are dispensed through a slot

###  &icon-flag; Summary

Functions are a fundamental unit of programs, which we can use to break down
tasks. Functions take in arguments and return data, just like programs.
Functions are a powerful way for programmers to share code with each other,
too. Some functions are known as methods, and are strongly associated with a
value.
