In this lesson, you will learn some practical techniques for fixing a program
that has errors. These techniques are known as "debugging", and can be
difficult to learn - you will get better with them as you practice.

###  &icon-check-plus; Objectives

  1. Choose the most suitable debugging method to debug a program
  2. Compare and contrast different debugging techniques
  3. Explain how you can use automatic tracing tools to debug a program
  4. Explain how you can use print debugging to debug a program
  5. Explain how you can use code tracing to debug a program
  6. Explain how you can google to debug a program
  7. Explain how you can use rubber duck debugging

**Slide 1 - Debugging:**  
Let's learn about Debugging.

**Slide 2 - What is Debugging?:**  
When a program doesn't work, we say that it has a "bug" in it. When we get rid
of bugs, we call it "Debugging". The first actual case of debugging a computer
program was when Admiral Grace Hopper found a moth trapped inside of a relay
of the Mark II Computer. Nowadays, our bugs usually don't involve live
insects.

**Slide 3 - The Scientific Method:**  
When you're debugging code, you should approach it using the scientific
method. First, we observe a failure in our code. Second, develop a hypothesis
as to why the code failed. Third, use this hypothesis to make a prediction.
Fourth, test the prediction by experimenting with the code and making
observations. Fifth, repeat steps 3 and 4 until you have fixed the code. This
may be intuitive to some people, but formally following this method can really
help train yourself as a programmer!

**Slide 4 - Wolf Fencing:**  
"There's one wolf in Alaska, how do you find it? First build a fence down the
middle of the state, wait for the wolf to howl, determine which side of the
fence it is on. Repeat process on that side only, until you get to the point
where you can see the wolf. In other words; put in a few "print" statements
until you find the statement that is failing (then maybe work backwards from
the "tracks" to find out where the wolf/bug comes from). This method is also
known as "Print Debugging".

**Slide 5 - Rubber Duck Debugging:**  
Okay, this will sound weird. First, get yourself a rubber duck or a wise
stuffed animal. Second, politely inform the duck that you will be explaining
your code to it. Third, explain what your code is supposed to do in general,
and the go over each line of code to the rubber duck. At some point, you will
tell the rubber duck what you are supposed to be doing next, and you will
realize that's not actually what your code does. Fourth, thank the duck for
its excellent work. This may sound crazy, but rubber ducks are actually the
world's best coders.

optional!

###  &icon-flag; Summary

When you encounter an error, you should attempt to debug them (using print
statements, meticulously explaining your code, etc.).
