In today's lesson, you'll learn how we use programs by running them. You will
also be trying BlockPy.

###  &icon-check-plus; Objectives

  1. Explain the meaning of the terms "run" and "execute".
  2. Use BlockPy to run a program.

**Slide 1 - Execution:**  
Let's learn about Executing Programs.

**Slide 2 - Executing a Program:**  
Once a program is written, it can be executed. This means that the computer
will read the text of the program line by line, and perform each step.

**Slide 3 - Terminology:**  
We say that a program is "Run" or "Executed".

**Slide 4 - Python:**  
Python is two things: First, as a programming language it is a set of rules
for writing Python programs. Second, it is a program that can execute programs
written in the Python programming language.

**Slide 5 - Programming Environments:**  
Technically, you can write programs in a text editor and then run them with
Python separately. However, most programmers use a Programming Environment
that makes it very easy to write programs and then press a single button to
run them.

**Slide 6 - Programs are Text:**  
When you write a Python program, you are really just writing some text. That
text needs to be valid Python text, following all of it syntax rules. But that
means its not that different from an essay you might write in English.

###  &icon-document; Optional Readings

The following readings should be relevant. Remember, all readings are
optional!

  * Automate the Boring Stuff: [Chapter 1, about the first half](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter1/)
  * Coding for Beginners: Pages 10-17, but I don't recommend using IDLE.
  * How to Think like a Computer Scientist: [Chapters 1.3](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/GeneralIntro/ThePythonProgrammingLanguage.html) \- [1.11](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/GeneralIntro/FormalandNaturalLanguages.html)
