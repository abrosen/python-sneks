In this lesson, you will learn about how to write programs use input and
output.

###  &icon-check-plus; Objectives

  1. Use the "input" function to retrieve input from the user
  2. Use the "print" function to display data to the user
  3. Identify possible outputs of a program (printing, graphics, robots)
  4. Identify possible inputs to a program (keyboard, mouse, files, sensors)
  5. Explain the necessity of "print" vs. debugging tools

**Slide 1 - Console I/O:**  
Let's learn about Console Inputs and Outputs.

**Slide 2 - Phases of a Program:**  
Every program has three main phases: The inputs are given to the program,
processing occurs, and outputs are returned. The Inputs and Outputs are how we
connect programs to the real world.

**Slide 3 - Programming is Like Baking:**  
Think of it like baking. The inputs are your ingredients. Mixing and stirring
are the processing. Then the cake is your output.

**Slide 4 - Inputs:**  
Examples of input are data typed by a keyboard, movements made by your mouse,
data from the internet, and data from sensors.

**Slide 5 - Outputs:**  
Examples of output are pixels on your screen, paper out of your printer, or
the movement of a robotic arm.

**Slide 6 - Console:**  
Computers take in data from users and put out results. One of the most common
ways to do this is the console. You can think of the console as like a
messenger box, for giving instructions to the computer.

**Slide 7 - Code:**  
The instructions that we write are often stored in a program, so that they can
be reused. This is what "programs" or "code" really is. Now let's learn how to
write a very simple program by learning two kinds of commands: "Print" and
"Input". We will see these two commands as regular Python text, but also as
BlockPy blocks.

**Slide 8 - Print:**  
The "print" function lets you write information to users. Printing is
necessary because we cannot see "inside" the mind of the computer, except what
it writes on the console. Notice that there is some text between the
parentheses: this is the text that is output to the user.

**Slide 9 - Input:**  
The "input" function lets you get information from users. Notice that there is
some text between the parentheses: this is the text that is shown as a prompt
to the user. Once the prompt is shown, the user can type their answer and
press enter.

**Slide 10 - A Simple Program:**  
Notice how we can combine these two commands by snapping them together. This
simple program will take some text from the user and then print it out. The
print statement does not print the word "input " - it prints out what the user
typed in the box. While not a very exciting program, it is a great example of
the input/output mechanism of programs.

**Slide 11 - But Why?:**  
The goal of any program is to transform the inputted data into the desired
outputs. For now, our programs will have simple inputs and simple outputs. But
eventually, we will create complex code that can achieve great things.

###  &icon-flag; Summary

Programs take input (such as from keyboards or sensors) and then output to the
user (such as through monitors or printers).
