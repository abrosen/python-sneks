computers as values.

**Slide 1 - Values:**  
Let's learn about Values

**Slide 2 - Values Represent the World:**  
Programming is all about inputting data so that we can manipulate it to get
some output. Therefore, we use values to represent the real world as data in
the computer.

**Slide 3 - Values:**  
Values can represent anything in the real world that we can measure and
concretely describe. Distances, temperatures, peoples' ages, our names, even
the text of entire books.

**Slide 4 - Writing Values:**  
When we write values directly in code, we call them "Literal Values", as
opposed to values in a file or received as input from a user. Sometimes we
also call this "Hard Coding a value". These hard-coded values are usually
useful for developing simple programs.

**Slide 5 - Printing Values:**  
Once we have put data into the computer as values, we need to do something
with it. A very simple action is to simply print it out. Soon, we will learn
more complex actions. Look at these examples of how we can write literal
values and then print them out.

**Slide 6 - Understanding Values:**  
It is very easy to put values into the computer. However, it is very difficult
to immediately understand what those values mean. It is up to us programmers
to communicate the meaning of values.
