**Slide 1 - Types:**  
Let's learn about Types.

**Slide 2 - The Basic Types:**  
All values in Python have a type. The five basic types are: Integer, Float,
String, Boolean, and None. There are many other types you will learn about.

**Slide 3 - What are Types:**  
Types control what you can and cannot do with things. We know that a number is
a number because we can add it to another number, or subract it, or multiply
it. We can add two strings together, but we cannot subtract them - this is one
reason why a string and a number are different.

**Slide 4 - Integer Types:**  
Integer types are whole numbers. They include both negative and positive
numbers, so there are a lot of them. Integer is often shortened to " Int " for
convenience.

**Slide 5 - Float Types:**  
When numbers have decimals, we call them Float types. The period is what
distinguishes Floats and Integers. Remember - if a number has a period in it,
then it is a float!

**Slide 6 - String Types:**  
Textual data is represented using String values. The tricky thing about
Strings is that *anything* can be stored as a String. The only thing that
makes it a string is the quotes. A special case is the "empty string", which
is a pair of quotes with nothing inside. String is often shorted to " Str "
for convenience.

**Slide 7 - Boolean Types:**  
Surprisingly often in programming, we are faced with "yes or no" values; these
are referred to as Boolean values. Specifically, we have a `True` and a
`False` value. Note that the T and F are capitalized, and there are no quotes
around the words. Boolean is often shortened to "Bool" for convenience.

**Slide 8 - The None Type:**  
Sometimes, you need to represent the absence of value, which we call None. The
None type is a special type that has only one value, which is also named None.
The None type can be hard to wrap your head around, but it doesn't come up too
often. For now, just remember that it has a capital N, and no quotes.

###  &icon-flag; Summary

Every value has a type, which determines what the data can do. The five basic
types in Python are Strings, Floats, Integers, Booleans, and None.
