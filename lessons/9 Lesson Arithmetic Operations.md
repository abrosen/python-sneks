In this lesson, you will learn about how to create arithmetic expressions. In
other words, how you use math when programming.

**Slide 1 - Arithmetic:**  
Let's learn about Arithmetic.

**Slide 2 - Purpose:**  
In some ways, computers are just large machines for doing arithmetic.
Computers are very, very good at doing math. In fact, modern computers can
perform billions or even trillions of calculations per second.

**Slide 3 - Operators:**  
There are six basic mathematical operators in Python that you should be
familiar with: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division,
Exponentiation, and Modulo.

**Slide 4 - Addition and Subtraction:**  
The plus sign (+) and minus sign (-) are used for addition and subtraction.

**Slide 5 - Multiplication and Exponentiation:**  
One asterisk (*) is used for multiplication. Two asterisks (**) are used for
exponents (also known as powers).

**Slide 6 - Division:**  
The forward slash is used for division. When you divide two integers, you will
always get a floating point number. I'll say that again - whenever you do
division, the result will always be a float! Keep in mind, you cannot divide
by 0!

**Slide 7 - Modulo:**  
You have probably never heard of the Modulo operator, but it's simple: it
calculates the remainder. Modulo is sometimes called "Clock Arithmetic",
because it makes it easy to figure out time. If someone said "It is 1600
hours", you could do "16 modulo 12" and find out they meant "4pm". However,
modulo has many other uses, such as for figuring out if numbers are even or
odd.

**Slide 8 - Using the Operators:**  
When you run a program with operators, Python will do the math and then
replace the result. You will not be able to see the computer do the math by
looking at just the code! Notice the difference between the code on the left,
and the actual actions that occur on the right.

**Slide 9 - Order of Operations:**  
When you use operators, there is an order of operations. Parentheses,
Exponent, Multiplication, Modulo, Division, Addition, Subtraction. Whenever
there's a tie, the left-most operation happens first. Notice that you can
always override any ordering by using parentheses. You might already be
familiar with this order: if not, here is a useful mnemonic: Please Excuse My
Most Dear Aunt Sally.

###  &icon-document; Optional Readings

The following readings should be relevant. Remember, all readings are
optional!

  * Automate the Boring Stuff: [Chapter 1, still the first half](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter1/) ; it's interesting how fast they blaze through this.
  * Coding for Beginners: Pages 36-48
  * How to Think like a Computer Scientist: [2.7](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/SimplePythonData/OperatorsandOperands.html) and [2.9](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/SimplePythonData/OrderofOperations.html)

###  &icon-flag; Summary

Mathematical operators like +, -, and * can be used to combine mathematical
values.
