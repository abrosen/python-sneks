<strong>Slide 1 - Execution:</strong><br>
Let's learn about Executing Programs.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Slide 2 - Executing a Program:</strong><br>
Once a program is written, it can be executed.
This means that the computer will read the text of the program line by line, and perform each step.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Slide 3 - Terminology:</strong><br>
We say that a program is "Run" or "Executed".
</p>

<p>
<strong>Slide 4 - Python:</strong><br>
Python is two things:
First, as a programming language it is a set of rules for writing Python programs.
Second, it is a program that can execute programs written in the Python programming language.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Slide 5 - Programming Environments:</strong><br>
Technically, you can write programs in a text editor and then run them with Python separately.
However, most programmers use a Programming Environment that makes it very easy to write programs and then press a single button to run them.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Slide 6 - Programs are Text:</strong><br>
When you write a Python program, you are really just writing some text.
That text needs to be valid Python text, following all of it syntax rules.
But that means its not that different from an essay you might write in English.
