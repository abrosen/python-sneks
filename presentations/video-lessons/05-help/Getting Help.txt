Let's 
learn about 
Getting Help.
Problems happen.
Even professional programmers ask each other for help.
It is important that you ask for help as effectively as possible.
Whether you're writing to the instructor for help, posting on the forum, or using a site like Stack Overflow, there are a few steps to keep in mind.
Keep the title concise and specific.
Quickly orient the reader to your intended question.
Pretend you're writing to a very busy colleague and don't waste their time.
Sometimes, it helps to write the title after you've written the rest of the question.
Next, in the body of your email or post, clearly describe what you are trying to make your program do.
If possible, also clearly describe any inputs to your program, and what you expected it to do.
Third, describe what is going wrong.
If possible, give the exact, specific error message you are getting.
If there is no error, then precisely describe what you think is going wrong.
A major goal is to let others reproduce the problem themselves.
Therefore, including your code or answer is crucial.
When pasting code, pay attention to formatting and make sure that it was not changed.
Consider using a site like "https://pastebin.com" to transfer the code, or send the Python file directly.
Communicating clearly is a hallmark of a professional, no matter what discipline you're in.
Although grammar, spelling, and punctuation may seem distracting, they are important.
If the reader cannot understand you, it will take a very long time to get the help you want.
