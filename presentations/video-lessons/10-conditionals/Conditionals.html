<strong>Slide 1 - Conditionals:</strong><br>
Let's learn about Conditionals.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Slide 2 - Purpose:</strong><br>
One of the major reasons that programs are useful is because they can do different things depending on their inputs.
To be able to make these decisions, we need to be able to write "conditional expressions".
Think of these as a question.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Slide 3 - Comparison Operators:</strong><br>
Often, we want to know about the relationship between two numbers.
For this, we use the comparison operators.
Each of these operators takes two numbers and returns either True or False.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Slide 4 - == (Equal Operator):</strong><br>
Okay, this is 
gonna
 sound weird, but in Python we use two equal signs to test for equality.
Do not use one equal sign, that means something different.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Slide 5 - != (Not equal operator):</strong><br>
This will be even weirder.
In Python, to test if two things are NOT equal, we use an exclamation mark and an equal sign.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Slide 6 - <, <=, >, >= (Greater and Less Than):</strong><br>
There are four other operators:
The less than operator, the greater than operator, the less than or equal to operator, and the greater than or equal to operator.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Slide 7 - Returning True or False:</strong><br>
I said before that the operators return either True or False.
Mentally imagine the result of these operations being replaced by True or False.
If you print the value, it will literally be True or False.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Slide 8 - Boolean Operators:</strong><br>
In the same way we can add and subtract numeric expressions together, we can also combine 
booleans
 expressions together.
There are three operators for this: And, Or, and Not
</p>

<p>
<strong>Slide 9 - And:</strong><br>
And returns True if both the left and right expressions are True.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Slide 10 - Or:</strong><br>
Or returns True if either the left or right expressions are True.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Slide 11 - Not:</strong><br>
Not returns True if the expression is False.
Unlike AND 
and
 OR, the NOT expression only takes in a single value.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Slide 12 - Nesting Conditionals:</strong><br>
You can connect conditionals into fairly complex expressions, just like you could with math.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Slide 13 - Conditionals Are Not Distributive:</strong><br>
A common beginner mistake is to think that you can distribute conditionals.
You might think that the code shown here asks if the number 5 is less than 1 or less than 2.
But the "or" operator makes the 2 evaluated separately.
To properly ask this question, you need to write the statement below, with the less than operator used a second time.
