<strong>Slide 1 - Errors:</strong><br>
Let's learn about Errors.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Slide 2 - Purpose:</strong><br>
When something goes wrong with your program, Python will give you an error message.
These messages are meant to help you find where your error is and what kind of error it is.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Slide 3 - Types of Error Messages:</strong><br>
Python has many, many error messages.
It can take a long time to learn them all.
When you encounter an error message you are unfamiliar with, you should first read and think about the message.
If you are not sure what it means, you should look up the error's meaning in the documentation.
Then, you can debug your program.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Slide 4 - Terminology:</strong><br>
Just a minor point of terminology.
Errors are sometimes referred to as "Exceptions".
They're not quite identical, but for our purposes they might as well be.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Slide 5 - Identify the error type:</strong><br>
Let's imagine that we ran some code, and encountered an error message.
In the bottom left of the error message, you can see the type of error.
In the example here, you can see that we have a "
TypeError
".
After the error type, there is usually some further description of the error.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Slide 6 - Find the Line:</strong><br>
It can be tricky to read, but the error message should also identify WHERE the error 
occured
.
Of course, sometimes the error is actually caused by code on a previous line.
You will have to think very critically about whether the error message is correct.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Slide 7 - Common Errors: :</strong><br>
Let's look at a few common errors.
First, here is a 
NameError
.
A 
NameError
 comes up when you try to reference a variable that does not exist yet.
Sometimes, you 
mispelled
 the name of the variable.
Sometimes, you have not initialized the variable.
Sometimes, you initialized the variable, but you did so AFTER its first usage.
In this case, there is a typo in the name "student grade".
</p>

<p>
<strong>Slide 8 - Common Errors: :</strong><br>
Another common error is the 
TypeError
, which occurs when you use an operator incorrectly.
For example, adding together a string and a number is not allowed.
When you read the error message that is produced, it will describe what went wrong.
Here, it says that we attempted to concatenate (which means combine) a string and an integer.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Slide 9 - Common Errors: :</strong><br>
A syntax error means that you broke Python's rules of spelling, grammar, and punctuation.
There are many ways to break a programs' syntax.
Usually, Python is very good at suggesting where the error is.
Still, sometimes it can be very tricky to track down a 
SyntaxError
.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Slide 10 - Debugging Errors:</strong><br>
We'll learn some more techniques to help you fix your broken problems in the coming weeks.
For now, think critically about the errors you receive.
When you see one you don't understand, you should ask "What does this error message mean?" instead of "What is wrong with my program?"
