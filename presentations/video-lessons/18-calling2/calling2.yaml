title: Calling Functions 2
video: DEKAWU12AAU
introduction: In this lesson, you'll learn more about calling functions and methods. In particular, you will learn how to read documentation about built-in functions that you can use. You will also learn how to nest, chain, and combine functions and methods.
objectives:
    - Interpret documentation for a function
    - Use a function based on its documentation
    - Distinguish between Parameters and Arguments
    - Nest a function call inside another function call
    - Chain a method onto another method
    - Combine functions, methods, and operators into a complex expression
activities:
    - "Lesson: Calling Functions 2"
    - "Quiz: Calling Functions 2"
    - "Programming: Calling Functions 2"
inclass:
    - Give examples of finding documentation "in the wild" (via google and the Python website).
    - Go over a list of all the built-in functions
    - Give an interactive example of combining multiple functions.
summary: Python comes with a huge number of built-in functions and methods. Programmers learn how to use these by referring to documentation. In practice, functions are often called in combination with other functions, methods, and operations.
