Let's learn about Documenting.
Programmers write documentation in order to explain what a function does.
This is useful not only for sharing code with other programmers, but when we come back to code we wrote later.
To document code, you create comments that are ignored when the code is executed.
These comments are for the benefit of humans, not the computer.
Python has two ways of writing comments.
To make a single-line comment in Python, you should use the hash symbol (also known as "pound" or "octothorpe", written as #).
Everything after the hash symbol on the same line is completely ignored by your program.
To write multi-line comments in Python, you actually create a triple-quoted string. 
When Python evaluates this string, the value is unused, so it is safely ignored by the computer.
However, unlike the single-line comment, that means that the start of a multi-line comment must respect indentation rules as shown here.
There are many opinions on when to write comments, and no "correct answer".
Some people believe you need to document every single line.
Some people believe you should only document functions and programs as a whole.
You will need to find your own balance - for example, rather than documenting every line, you might only document lines that are particularly confusing, or document a chunk of code.
Many people agree that, at a minimum, you should document all your functions.
Although there are many conventions, a typical function's documentation will be a multi-line string indented as the first line of the body of the function.
This documentation should explain what 1) the function does, 2) its parameters' types, 3) descriptions of its parameters, 4) its return type, and 5) a description of its returned value.
