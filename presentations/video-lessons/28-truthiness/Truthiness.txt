Let's learn about Truthiness.
Unlike some languages, Python does not require that IF statements have 
boolean
 expressions in their conditional.
This may seem surprising, but it is actually an extremely convenient feature named Truthiness.
The idea is that any expression, whether it is an integer, string, 
boolean
, or otherwise, can be evaluated in a conditional.
Any expression can be evaluated as a conditional according to the rules of Truthiness.
How it is evaluated depends on its type.
Let's look at a simple example, where we take some input from a user.
If the user entered an empty string, then we'll print out a different message.
When you need to check if a string is not empty, or a number is not 0, truthiness is the way to go.
Notice how each of the following can become much more concise and clear.
