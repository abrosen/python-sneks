<strong>Slide 1 - Mutability:</strong><br>
Let's learn about Mutability.

<strong>Slide 2 - Mutability:</strong><br>
Strings and lists are similar because they are both sequences of elements.
However, a big difference between them is their Mutability.
Strings are immutable while lists are mutable.

<strong>Slide 3 - Immutable Strings:</strong><br>
Say you have a string variable.
When you add another string to that variable, you need to assign the result - otherwise it is lost.
Similarly, when you call a string method, you need to assign the result - otherwise it is lost.
This is the idea of immutability - you are never changing the string, you are simply creating new ones.

<p>
<strong>Slide 4 - Mutable Lists:</strong><br>
Now say you have a list variable.
When you append a value to that variable, you must not assign the result back.
The append method modifies the list variable, and then returns None, so if you assign its result you overwrite the list variable.
The append call mutated the list - it changed the data inside the list without affecting the list variable.
