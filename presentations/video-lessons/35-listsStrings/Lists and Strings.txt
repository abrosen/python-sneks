Let's learn more about Lists and Strings
Lists and Strings are somewhat similar, since they are both a sequence of things.
Strings are sequences of characters, but Lists can be a sequence of anything.
The key idea is that both Strings and Lists are sequences, which means that you can iterate over them with a FOR loop.
When you iterate over a list, you get each element.
When you iterate over a string, you get each character.
Often, instead of processing a list character-by-character, we want to process it word-by-word, or by some other chunking of characters.
To make this easy, strings have a method named split.
Split is an awesome method because it is easy to use.
As you can see below, after we have split a string, it is easy to loop over each word.
In this example, we separate each author to print them individually.
If you do not pass anything to split, then it splits on any kind of whitespace - spaces, tabs, new lines.
Sometimes, we want to split on other characters.
You can pass a string as an argument to split on a different character.
Here is a useful pattern.
You take a comma-separated string from the user, split the elements, and process each one in turn.
Notice how we can use this to process a string of numbers by converting them using the "
int
" function.
Study each statement of this pattern carefully, and make sure you understand it.
