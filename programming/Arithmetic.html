<h2>#1 - Addition</h2>
<div>
Using the + operator, print out the result of 5+2 (which will represent the number of days in a week, as the combination of weekdays and the weekend). Do not embed the result in your code. Let Python do the calculation for you.
</div>
<h2>#2 - Subtraction</h2>
<div>
Using the <span style="font-weight: bold;">-</span>&nbsp;operator, print out the result of 43-6 (which will represent the number of classes left in this course). Do not embed the result in your code. Let Python do the calculation for you.
</div>
<h2>#3 - Multiplication</h2>
<div>
<p>Using the * operator, print out the result of 24*365 (which will represent the number of hours in the year*). Do not embed the result in your code. Let Python do the calculation for you.</p>
</div>
<h2>#4 - Division</h2>
<div>
Using the / operator, print out the result of 33170/213 (which will represent the average number of students per building at Virginia Tech). Do not embed the result in your code. Let Python do the calculation for you.
</div>
<h2>#5 - Modulo</h2>
<div>
Using the % (modulo) operator, print out the result of 23%12 (which will convert "2300 hours" from military time to the regular 12-hour clock time). Do not embed the result in your code. Let Python do the calculation for you.
</div>
<h2>#6 - Exponents</h2>
<div>
Using the ** operator, print out the result of 2**10 (which is the size of a kilobyte, a common unit of measurement in computers). Do not embed the result in your code. Let Python do the calculation for you.
</div>
<h2>#7 - A</h2>
<div>
<p>Because computers are very good at doing math, we won't have to worry about doing much math in this course. In fact, learning how to program is actually more similar to learning a new language!</p><p>Regardless, it's good to remember how to do a little math. Print out the result of one more calculation, this time applying the Fahrenheit conversion formula to convert the temperature 50<span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-size: 16px; font-family: Helvetica;">°</span>F to Celsius. The formula is shown below:</p><p><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;; font-weight: bold;">Celsius = (Fahrenheit - 32) × 5/9</span></p><p>Remember, you should &nbsp;not embed the result directly into your code. You must print out the result of this calculation.</p>
