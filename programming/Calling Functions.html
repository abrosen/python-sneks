<h2>#1 - Rounding</h2>
<div>
The function <code>round</code> consumes a float number and returns it rounded to the nearest whole number. You are buying some food and want to know roughly how much it will cost. Use the round function to round $<code>9.50</code> to the nearest whole number.
</div>
<h2>#2 - Functions</h2>
<div>
This time, instead of immediately printing the result of rounding <code>9.50</code>, store the result into a new variable. Then print that variable.
</div>
<h2>#3 - Double</h2>
<div>
<p>The function <code>float</code> consumes a string and converts it to a float. Use the <code>round</code> function and the <code>float</code> function together along with the <code>print</code> function to print the string <code>"9.50"</code> as a whole number after storing the result in a variable.</p><p>Here is an example of the <code>float</code> function being used:</p><pre>price = float("10.0")</pre><p></p>
</div>
