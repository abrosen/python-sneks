<h2>#1 - Simple</h2>
<div>
Conditional logic allows us to represent questions. Let's practice constructing some rudimentary questions. Use conditional logic to print the result of <code>-5 &lt; 5</code>. The new blocks that you will need are in the "Decision" category.
</div>
<h2>#2 - Yes</h2>
<div>
<p>Conditional logic results in either <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>. These are boolean values, and they can be used within conditional expressions. Conditional expressions can be expanded further using the <code>and</code> and <code>or</code> operators.</p><p>Use conditional logic to print the result of the expression <code>True or False</code>. You will need blocks from the "Decision", "Values", and "Output" categories. Make sure that you are using Boolean values and not String values!</p>
</div>
<h2>#3 - Inequalities</h2>
<div>
Now let's try a more complex expression. Use conditional logic to print the result of <code>1 != 2 and 2 != 1</code>
</div>
<h2>#4 - Lies!!</h2>
<div>
Just one more expression, and this one should be fairly simple. Use conditional logic to print the result of <code>not True</code>
</div>
