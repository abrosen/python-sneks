<h2>#1 - Try</h2>
<div>
<p>Welcome back to BlockPy! Last time, we saw how we could run a program. Let's review that.</p><p>Click the green "Run" button below to run your program. You do not have to edit the program yet.</p>
</div>
<pre><code>
# Starting Code:
print("This is the output")

</code></pre>
<h2>#2 - Now</h2>
<div>
<p>Now you will write your own Python. Drag the PRINT block in the "Output' category and the green STRING LITERAL block in the "Values" category onto the canvas in order to print the phrase "Hello World". Be sure to observe the Python code that you wrote on the right!</p><p>Hint: The STRING LITERAL block is the green block with quotation marks.</p>
</div>
<h2>#3 - Print</h2>
<div>
This time, print your name. We won't check that you've printed your actual name, so feel free to print something else instead!
</div>
<h2>#4 - Print</h2>
<div>
The "INPUT" block below retrieves input from the user. Notice how it can connect on the left? Connect a "PRINT" block to it, then try running the program. You will need to enter some text into the box that appears and then press "Enter".
</div>
<pre><code>
# Starting Code:
input("This is the prompt to the user.")
</code></pre>
