<h2>#1 - A</h2>
<div>
The function below calculates the average of two numbers. However, it is not being used correctly. Modify the program so that it runs correctly.
</div>
<pre><code>
# Starting Code:
print(average_numbers(2, 8))
def average_numbers(first, second):
    return (first+second)/2

</code></pre>
<h2>#2 - A</h2>
<div>
Create a function named <code>do_nothing</code> that has no parameters, no return values, and does absolutely nothing. Call this function and print the result.
</div>
<h2>#3 - Getting</h2>
<div>
<p>Write a function named <code>get_my_age</code> that returns your age as an int (this is YOUR age, so if you were 21 you would return the number 21). Note that this function takes no arguments and no input from the user. Call the function once and print the result.</p><p>Reflect on the difference between creating a variable with a constant value and creating a function with no arguments that returns a constant return value.</p>
</div>
<h2>#4 - Identity</h2>
<div>
<p>Write a function <code>identity</code> that consumes a number and returns that number, unmodified. This basic function (that accomplishes nothing) is known as the "identity function", because it leaves the parameter's identity unchanged. Call this function once and print the result.</p><p>For those who have programmed before, remember that you do not indicate a parameter's type in Python. Even though the instructions say that function consumes a number, you do not indicate this in the function definition.</p>
</div>
<h2>#5 - Adder</h2>
<div>
Write a function <code>add_together</code> that consumes two integer parameters and returns their sum. Call the function once, and then print the result.
</div>
