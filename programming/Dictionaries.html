<h2>#1 - Apartment</h2>
<div>
Represent the apartment below as a dictionary, store the dictionary in a variable, and then print that dictionary. Note that the values of your dictionary should be a string, a boolean, an integer, and a float (not necessarily in that order).<ul><li>Number of Bedrooms: 3</li><li>Has Backyard?: True</li><li>Rent per Month: 1247.55</li><li>Address: 1 Address</li></ul>
</div>
<h2>#2 - Name</h2>
<div>
Given the dictionary below, print the value associated with the key <code>"Name"</code>&nbsp;using a dictionary lookup.
</div>
<pre><code>
# Starting Code:
person = {5: "Apple", "Name": 5, "Apple": "Name"}
print(___)
</code></pre>
<h2>#3 - Name</h2>
<div>
Create a function named <code>get_name</code> that, given a dictionary, returns the value associated with the key <code>"Name"</code>. Try running this function by creating a new dictionary.
</div>
<h2>#4 - Default</h2>
<div>
<p>Create a function named <code>get_default_name</code> that, given a dictionary, returns the value associated with the key <code>"Dog's Name"</code>. However, if the key <code>"Dog's Name"</code> is missing, it should return the string <code>"No dog"</code>.</p><p><strong>Need some help?</strong> There is a <a href="https://think.cs.vt.edu/worked_examples/load?filename=dog_lookup.html&amp;assignment_id=244" target="_blank">Worked Example</a> available to help you on this problem!</p>

<h2>#5 - Dictionary</h2>
<div>
The dictionary below maps book titles to their prices. Using a <code>for</code> loop, print out each book title and its price, each on their own line. Recall that the <code>print</code> function can take more than one argument.
</div>
<pre><code>
# Starting Code:
book_prices = {
    "Alice in Wonderland": 6.99,
    "Chronicles of Narnia": 12.59,
    "A Tale of Two Cities": 5.70,
    "Count of Monte Cristo": 10.72
}
</code></pre>
<h2>#6 - Dictionary</h2>
<div>
<p>Needing to edit dictionaries is not very common, but sometimes it is useful. Write a function named <code>get_older</code> that consumes a dictionary (representing a person) and increases its <code>"Age"</code> key's value by <code>1</code>. The function should return the new age. Call the function on the two given person dictionaries to advance their ages, and print their returned values.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span>: This function <span style="font-style: italic;">modifies</span>&nbsp;the dictionary that it consumes. This is unusual and different from what we've done in the past, creating new dictionaries or lists. We sometimes want to modify dictionaries, but keep in mind that this makes it harder to reason about the program over all.</p>
</div>
<pre><code>
# Starting Code:
person1 = {"Name": "Charles Babbage", "Age": 17}
person2 = {"Name": "Ada Lovelace", "Age": 32}
</code></pre>
