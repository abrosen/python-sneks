<h2>#1 - JSON</h2>
<div>
You have started your own company (congratulations!) that sells cute dog pictures. The file available named <code>"sales.json"</code> holds the sales of each day of the past year. Use the <code>load</code> function of the <code>json</code> module and the <code>open</code> built-in function to access the data in this file and print the average sales for the entire year (using the Sum and Count pattern).
</div>
<h2>#2 - State</h2>
<div>
There is a file available named <code>"states.json"</code>, which contains a complete dictionary of the US states abbreviations mapped to their full names. Use the <code>load</code> function of the <code>json</code> module and the <code>open</code> built-in function to load the dictionary, and then use this dictionary to convert and print your home state's (or your favorite state's) abbreviation to it's full name.
</div>
<h2>#3 - Total</h2>
<div>
In the time since the first question, your dog picture company has boomed even further. You have now hired over a hundred employees. There is a file available named <code>"employees.json"</code>, which contains a list of dictionaries, each of which represents an employee. Use the <code>load</code> function of the <code>json</code> module and the <code>open</code> built-in function to access the data in this file, in order to calculate the total number of <code>"Dog Pictures Made"</code> by your employees. You should use the Sum pattern.
</div>
<h2>#4 - Max</h2>
<div>
<p>You are so pleased with your employees, you have decided to promote one. There is a file available named <code>"employees.json"</code>, which contains a list of dictionaries, each of which represents an employee. Use the <code>load</code> function of the <code>json</code> module and the <code>open</code> built-in function to access the data in this file to find the employee with the highest sales record. You should follow the Max pattern previously seen, but you will need to modify it in order to find the <code>"Name"</code> of the employee with the highest <code>"New Sales"</code>.</p><p>Tip: Start by calculating the the maximum of the <code>"New Sales"</code> field. Now, what additional information do you need to store in order to print the final result?</p>
