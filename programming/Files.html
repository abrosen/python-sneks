<h2>#1 - Basic</h2>
<div>
There is a file available named <code>"grocery_list.txt"</code>. You can view the file below. Use the built-in <code>open</code> function on the file, print each line using a <code>for</code> loop, and then <code>close</code> the file. Remember to remove the extra newline character from the end of each line using the <code>strip</code> method.
</div>
<h2>#2 - Redacted</h2>
<div>
<p>You are a spy. The file attached has a series of messages that need to be encrypted before being sent. Open the file <code>"messages.txt"</code>, and for each line, replace all instances of the name <code>"James Bond"</code> with <code>"[Redacted]"</code>, and then print the result.</p><p>Do not use the built-in <code>read</code> method of files.</p>
</div>
<h2>#3 - Adding</h2>
<div>
<p>You are a scientist studying the rainfall in the area. The file attached has a huge list of rainfalls for the past year. Sum the values in the file and print out the result. Recall that you can convert strings to floats using the <code>float</code> function.</p><p><strong>Hey Listen! Having trouble getting started?

</div>
<h2>#4 - Plus</h2>
<div>
<p>The file attached has a series of <code>"+"</code> and <code>"-"</code> characters, representing additions and subtractions. Create a function named <code>convert_operator</code>, which consumes a string (a single character, either a <code>"+"</code> or a <code>"-"</code>) and returns either <code>1</code> or <code>-1</code>, respectively. Then apply this function to the contents of each of the following files to calculate the sum of all these pluses and minuses (so an integer number). Notice that the <code>"plus and minus.txt"</code> file is entirely on one line. Therefore, you should use the <code>read</code> method to access its contents. But you should only pass one character at a time to the function you write!</p><p><strong>Hey listen! Having trouble getting started?

</div>
<h2>#5 - Fix</h2>
<div>
<p>Each line of the attached file is a pair of comma-separated last and first names (e.g., <code>washington,george</code>). Split each line, capitalize the first letter (use the <code>capitalize</code> method), and then print the names in the correct order (e.g., <code>George Washington</code>).</p><p><strong>Hey Listen!

</div>
<h2>#6 - File</h2>
<div>
<p>Write a function <code>calculate_file_size</code> that consumes the name of a file as a string and returns an integer indicating how many characters long the file's contents is using the Count pattern (you may not use the built-in <code>len</code> function). Call your function on one of the files below and print the result. Note that your function will be tested on each of the files given.</p><p><strong>Hey listen! Having trouble getting started?

<h2>#7 - Madlibs</h2>
<div>
<p>You are going to create some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs#Format" target="_blank">Mad Libs</a>. There are two files available: a word list full of common words (<code>"words.txt"</code>), and a short story (<code>"story.txt"</code>). Process both files line-by-line in order to replace the words from the first file in the short story with the string <code>"____"</code> (four underscores). Then, print the resulting story, each line of the story on its own line.</p><p>One issue you may encounter: You cannot loop through a file again after you have read its contents once. Solve this issue by storing the words file in a list before processing the story.</p><p>You may find it helpful to keep in mind the <a href="https://vt.instructure.com/courses/66476/pages/number-34-lesson-mutability" target="_blank">mutability</a> of certain types.</p><p>You may also find it helpful to refer to the <a href="https://vt.instructure.com/courses/66476/pages/reference-strings#replace" target="_blank">replace</a> documentation.</p>
