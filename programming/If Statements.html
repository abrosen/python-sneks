<h2>#1 - Rainy</h2>
<div>
<p>Use an <code>if</code> statement to capture the following logic:</p><pre>If the precipitation is greater than 50%,<br>    print "It will probably rain."<br>Otherwise,<br>    print "It might not rain."</pre><p>Set the value of precipitation to the current chance of precipitation tomorrow (<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=chance+of+precipitation+tomorrow" target="_blank">available here</a>).</p>
</div>
<h2>#2 - Driven</h2>
<div>
<p>The following three conditions test if the user is allowed to drink. Move the conditions into the given <code>if/else</code> statements to make the code correctly print out whether the user can drink. Initialize the variables with values appropriate to yourself (or make up the details, we don't want to pry).</p>
</div>
<pre><code>
# Starting Code:
# Remember to initialize the variables!

# Keep this If/else structure unchanged, but
# fill in the blanks
