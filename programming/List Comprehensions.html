<h2>#1 - Now</h2>
<div>
The following list represents the prices at a store. Write a List Comprehension that halves each element of the list and assigns the result to a new variable named <code>half_off_prices</code>. Print this new variable.
</div>
<pre><code>
# Starting Code:
original_prices = [100, 200, 300]
</code></pre>
<h2>#2 - Nothing</h2>
<div>
The following list represents the prices at a store. Write a List Comprehension that remoevs each element of the list that is greater than $100, and assigns the result to a new variable named <code>low_prices</code>. Print this new variable.
</div>
<pre><code>
# Starting Code:
original_prices = [50, 100, 200]
</code></pre>
<h2>#3 - Whitespace</h2>
<div>
Frequently, data downloaded from the internet will have unnecessary whitespace. The <code>strip</code> method of strings is a useful way to clean up these strings. The string below was taken from a website that lists cute dog names. Do me a favor and clean up the list of strings using a list comprehension, then print the result.
</div>
<pre><code>
# Starting Code:
[" Doctor Bark  ", " Virginia Woof ", "Jabba the Mutt     "]
</code></pre>
<h2>#4 - Filter</h2>
<div>
Another common issue with data downloaded from the internet is that there will be blank entries. The following list is supposed to only have cute cat names. Use a list comprehension to remove the empty strings but keep the names.
</div>
<pre><code>
# Starting Code:
["", "Katy Purry", "", "", "Cat Damon", "", "Catsanova"]

</code></pre>
