<h2>#1 - Append</h2>
<div>
The list below is meant to represent the animals of a zoo, but it is currently empty. Use the append method to add 3 new animals of your choice. Print the list afterwards.
</div>
<pre><code>
# Starting Code:
zoo = []
</code></pre>
<h2>#2 - First</h2>
<div>
Use list indexing to print the first and second elements of the list below on separate lines.
</div>
<pre><code>
# Starting Code:
temperatures = [50, 60, 55, 35, 50, 65]
</code></pre>
<h2>#3 - Last</h2>
<div>
<p>Use list indexing to print the last element of the list literal value.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note: </span>Do not store the list value into a temporary variable. The goal is to practice indexing a list literal, to show that it is possible.</p>
</div>
<pre><code>
# Starting Code:
["Not me", "Nor me", "Print me!"]
</code></pre>
<h2>#4 - Bookend</h2>
<div>
Create a function <code>bookend_list</code> that consumes a list as a parameter and returns the first and last elements as a new list. If the original list is empty, return an empty list instead. Call and print this function twice.
</div>
<h2>#5 - Membership</h2>
<div>
You are developing a system to process lists of days of the week, represented as strings. Create a function <code>is_weekend</code> that consumes a list and returns whether the list has the string <code>"Saturday"</code> or the string <code>"Sunday"</code> in it. Call and print this function once with a list of days of the week.
</div>
<h2>#6 - Lengthy</h2>
<div>
The <code>len</code> function consumes a list and returns its length as an integer. Use the <code>len</code> function to write your own function <code>check_length</code> that consumes a list and returns whether it is 3-5 items long. Call and print this function twice.
</div>
