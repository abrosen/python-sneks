<h2>#1 - Sum</h2>
<div>
The code below is meant to sum a list of comma-separated numbers in a string. Fix the code below so that it will correctly sum and print the values.
</div>
<pre><code>
# Starting Code:
scores = "44,34,27,43,22,25"
total_score = 0
for a_score in total_score.split(","):
    total_score = int(a_score)
print(total_score)
</code></pre>
<h2>#2 - Animal</h2>
<div>
<p>Write a function <code>all_cats</code> that consumes a comma-separated string of animals and prints whether all of the animals have <code>"cat"</code> in their name. For example, the string <code>"gerbil,catfish,dog,cat"</code> would return&nbsp;<code>False</code>, but just&nbsp;<code>"cat,catfish"</code> would return <code>True</code>. If the function consumes an empty string, then it returns&nbsp;<span style="background-color: rgb(249, 242, 244); color: rgb(199, 37, 78); font-family: Menlo, Monaco, Consolas, &quot;Courier New&quot;, monospace; font-size: 12.6px;">True</span>. Call this function on a string of animals of your choice and print the result.</p>
</div>
<h2>#3 - Hot</h2>
<div>
<p>A scientist has been recording observations of the temperature for the past while. On hot days, they write <code>"H"</code>, and for cold days, they write <code>"C"</code>. Instead of using a list, they kept all of these observations in a single long string (e.g., <code>"HCH"</code> would be a hot day, followed by a cold day, and then another hot day).</p><p>Write a function <code>add_hot_cold</code> that consumes a string of observations and returns the number of hot days minus the number of cold days. To accomplish this, you should process each letter in turn and add <code>1</code> if it is hot, and <code>-1</code> if it is cold. For example, the string <code>"HCH"</code> would result in <code>1</code>, while the string <code>"CHCC"</code> would result in <code>-2</code>. </p><p>You cannot use the built-in <code>count</code> method or the <code>len</code> function. Call your function on the string <code>"HHHHHCCCHCHHHCHCHC"</code>&nbsp;and print the result.</p>
</div>
<h2>#4 - Sum</h2>
<div>
Recall the Input/Split/Loop pattern and the Sum pattern. Combine these two patterns to read in a comma-separated string of numbers from the user, separate each number, and then print the sum of these numbers. For example, if the user typed in the string <code>"10,20,30"</code>, your code should print <code>60</code>.
