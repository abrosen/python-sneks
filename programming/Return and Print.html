<h2>#1 - Print</h2>
<div>
Write a function <code>print_greeting</code> that consumes a name (as a string value) and prints out <code>Hello X</code>, where <code>X</code> is the given name. So for example, if the name <code>"Bruce Wayne"</code> was passed in, the function should print <code>Hello Bruce Wayne</code>.
</div>
<h2>#2 - Return</h2>
<div>
<p>Write a function <code>return_greeting</code> that consumes a name (as a string value) and returns&nbsp;<code>Hello X</code>, where <code>X</code> is the given name. So for example, if the name <code>"Bruce Wayne"</code> was passed in, the function should return&nbsp;<code>Hello Bruce Wayne</code>. Call the function and then print the result.</p><p>In other words, same thing as the previous problem, except this time the function returns instead of printing.</p>
</div>
<h2>#3 - Used</h2>
<div>
<p>Create a function named <code>pluralize</code> that consumes a string and returns that string with an <code>"s"</code> at the end (so <code>"dog"</code> would become <code>"dogs"</code>). Then, call this function on the string <code>"Dog"</code> and assign the result to a variable in order to create the output <code>"Dogs can pet other Dogs"</code>. Some code is given to you to help you get started.</p><p>Notice that because this function <span style="font-style: italic;">returned </span>a value, that value could be reused multiple times.</p>
</div>
<pre><code>
# Starting Code:
noun = ___
print(noun + " can pet other " + noun)
</code></pre>
<h2>#4 - Body</h2>
<div>
The function definition below is correctly named and has two parameters, but has an error in its body. Fix the error so that it will returns the correct result when it is called.
</div>
<pre><code>
# Starting Code:
def calculate_area(height, width):
    print(height*width)

print(calculate_area(10, 20))
print(calculate_area(20, 30))
print(calculate_area(15, 20))
</code></pre>
<h2>#5 - Making</h2>
<div>
Write a function <span style="color: rgb(199, 37, 78); font-family: Menlo, Monaco, Consolas, &quot;Courier New&quot;, monospace; font-size: 12.6px;">make_receipt&nbsp;</span>that consumes a float representing the price of a meal. The function needs to do the following:<ol>    <li>Calculate the discounted price by multiplying the price by <code>.9</code> (a 10% discount)</li>    <li>Return the discounted price.</li>    <li>Print out the original price passed in.</li>    <li>Print out the discounted price.</li></ol>Now, you just bought a meal for $20, but the manager was so impressed with your programming ability that they decided to discount it twice. Call this function on the original $20 meal price twice. 
</div>
