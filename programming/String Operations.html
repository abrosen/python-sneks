<h2>#1 - Grab</h2>
<div>
Use subscripting to write code that will extract and print the word "dog" from "cat dog mouse".
</div>
<pre><code>
# Starting Code:
animals = "cat dog mouse"
print(animals)
</code></pre>
<h2>#2 - Boss's</h2>
<div>
Your boss sent you a spreadsheet full of client names, but has accidentally added the phrase "is stupid" to the end of each one. Demonstrate to your boss how you can fix all of the emails by using string subscripting to remove the last 11 characters, and then print the result.
</div>
<pre><code>
# Starting Code:
example_client_name = "Dan Danielson is stupid"
example_client_name
</code></pre>
<h2>#3 - Subscript</h2>
<div>
The subscripting below is incorrect. Instead of printing out the last character, it is crashing. Fix the code so that it prints out the last character.
</div>
<pre><code>
# Starting Code:
print("Python"[6])
</code></pre>
<h2>#4 - Another</h2>
<div>
The subscripting below is incorrect. Instead of printing out the website name, it is crashing. Fix the code so that it prints out the correct number of characters.
</div>
<pre><code>
# Starting Code:
print([4:-4]"www.facebook.com")

</code></pre>
<h2>#5 - A</h2>
<div>
The subscripting below is incorrect. Instead of printing out the first character, it is crashing. Fix the code so that it prints out the correct number of characters.
</div>
<pre><code>
# Starting Code:
letters = "ABCDEF"
print(0[letters])

</code></pre>
<h2>#6 - Order</h2>
<div>
<p>The code below stores the string value <code>"order out of"</code> into the variable a_phrase. Using only string subscripting and the addition operator, print the phrase <code>"out of order"</code>.</p><p>Worked Example: This problem has a <a href="https://vt.instructure.com/courses/66476/pages/example-string-indexing" target="_blank">worked example</a> that might help give you some guidance.</p>
</div>
<pre><code>
# Starting Code:
a_phrase = "order out of"
print(a_phrase)
</code></pre>
<h2>#7 - User</h2>
<div>
Write a program that takes in input from the user and prints whether or not it contains the string "dog". Recall that you can use the "input()" command (already present below) to get input from the user. When completed, your program will accept such strings as "dog", "bulldog", and "dogfish" - all of which are good dogs. Your entire program should be one line long.
</div>
<pre><code>
# Starting Code:
input("What's your favorite animal?")
</code></pre>
