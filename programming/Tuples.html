<h2>#1 - Multiple</h2>
<div>
Merge these two assignment statements into a single line using multiple assignment and a tuple.
</div>
<pre><code>
# Starting Code:
department = "CS"
number = 1064
print(department, number)
</code></pre>
<h2>#2 - Splitting</h2>
<div>
Use the <code>split</code> method to split the following string variable (representing a date of the form "Month/Day/Year") into three variables, all of which will be printed on one line.
</div>
<pre><code>
# Starting Code:
date = "10/31/2017"

print(month, day, year)
</code></pre>
<h2>#3 - Multiple</h2>
<div>
<p>Create a function <code>get_ends</code> that consumes a string and returns a tuple of two values: the first letter of the string and the last letter of the string, both upper-cased. For example, the string <code>"Python"</code> would return <code>("P", "N")</code>. Call this function on a string of your choice and assign the result to two variables (using multiple assignment), and then print each variable.</p><p><b>Having trouble?</b> Check out this <a href="https://think.cs.vt.edu/worked_examples/load?filename=10_grade_lookup.html&amp;assignment_id=278" target="_blank">worked example</a>!</p>
