<h2>#4 - Grading</h2>
<div>
<p>The formula below calculates a curved grade by applying a square root:</p><pre>curved_grade = original_grade<sup>.5</sup> * 10</pre><p>Define a function named <code>curve_grade</code> that consumes a grade and uses the formula to return the curved grade. Call the function three times to demonstrate how it works, making sure to print the result each time.</p>
</div>
<h2>#5 - A</h2>
<div>
Write a function <code>begins_with_vowel</code> that consumes a non-empty string and returns whether the first character of that string is a vowel. A simple way to test if a single character is a vowel is to determine if it is in the string <code>"AEIOU"</code>. Keep in mind that your function should work for both uppercase and lowercase letters. Print the result of calling your function twice on two different strings of your choosing. 

<b>Note:</b> Do not use any <code>if</code> statements in solving this.
