<h2>#1 - No</h2>
<div>
Replace the <code>while</code> below with a <code>for</code> loop by using the built-in function <code>range</code>, which consumes a number and returns a list up to that number. For example, <code>range(5)</code> returns the list <code>[0,1,2,3,4]</code>. In the end, the code should print out the sum of the numbers from 0 to 100.
</div>
<pre><code>
# Starting Code:
sum_of_n = 0
index = 0
while index < 100:
    sum_of_n = sum_of_n + index
    index += 1
print(sum_of_n)
</code></pre>
<h2>#2 - While</h2>
<div>
<p>Use a <code>while</code> loop to repeatedly take <code>input</code> from the user and print whatever they type in. When the user enters the empty string (<code>""</code>), then your program should stop.&nbsp;</p><p>Note that if your program accidentally loops forever, your browser may become unresponsive for up to 15 seconds. Be very careful while writing <code>while</code> loops!</p>
</div>
<h2>#3 - Sum</h2>
<div>
Use a <code>while</code> loop to repeatedly take <code>input</code> from the user and calculate a sum. The user will only be allowed to type in numbers, but remember the <code>input</code> function returns strings (so you will need to convert them with the built-in <code>int</code> function). If the user inputs the value <code>-999</code>, then the program should stop and print out the sum of all the numbers entered.
</div>
