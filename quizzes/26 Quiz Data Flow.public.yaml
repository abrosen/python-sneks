- question_name: FlowReturn
  question_type: true_false_question
  question_text: You can use the `return` statement to return a variable from a function.
  points_possible: 1.0
- question_name: FlowParameters
  question_type: true_false_question
  question_text: |-
    Values enter functions as arguments when the function is called, and then the
    arguments' values are assigned to parameters when the function's body begins
    executing.

- question_name: FlowPrint
  question_type: true_false_question
  question_text: The `print` function is necessary to call a function.

- question_name: FlowShare
  question_type: true_false_question
  question_text: |-
    The two functions below share a variable named `score`:

    ```python

    def increase(score):
        return score+1
    def decrease(score):
        return score-1

    ```

    Given the program below,

    ```python

    name = input("What is your name?")
    def fix_capitalization(name):
        return name.title().strip()
    def print_message(name):
        print("Hello", name, "how are you?")

    ```

    Which of the following lines of code will have the data flow correctly through
    both functions in order to print the message with the fixed capitalization?
  points_possible: 3.0
  answers:
  - |-
    ```python

    fix_capitalization(name)
    print_message(name)

    ```
  - |-
    ```python

    print_message(fix_capitalization(name))

    ```
  - |-
    ```python

    fix_capitalization()
    print_message()

    ```
  - |-
    ```python

    print(fix_capitalization(name))
    print(print_message(name))

    ```
  - |-
    ```python

    name = fix_capitalization(name)
    print_message(name)

    ```
  - None are necessary, because the variables share the same name.
- question_name: FlowSubstitution

    Given the program below:

    ```python

    def x(a):
        return 6+a
    def y(a):
        return a*2
    def z(a):
        return a-1
    **print(x(y(z(3))))**

    ```

    Match each blank to the value that will be substituted as the last line is
    executed:
