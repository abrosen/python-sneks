    Fill out the trace table below by following the execution. If the value is not
    yet defined, place an "X".

    ```python

    1 | salary = 1000
    2 | if salary > 100:
    3 |    taxes = .5
    4 | else:
    5 |    taxes = .1
    6 | salary = taxes * salary
    7 | if salary > 100:
    8 |    if salary < 500:
    9 |        taxes = 0
    10|    salary = taxes * salary  

    ```

    step | line | salary | taxes  
    ---|---|---|---  
    1 | 1 | 1000 | X  
    2 | 2 | 1000 | [taxes2]  
    3 | [line3] | 1000 | [taxes3]  
    4 | 6 | [salary4] | [taxes4]  
    5 | [line5] | [salary5] | [taxes5]  
    6 | [line6] | [salary6] | [taxes6]

    What is the value of `number_of_users` after this program executes?

    ```python

    if False:
        number_of_users = 5
    print(number_of_users))

    ```
  points_possible: 1.0
  answers:
  - No value, because an error occurs since the value has not been defined
  - 0, because that is the default value for integer variables
  - None, because that is the default value for all variables
  - 5, because of the assignment on line 2.
