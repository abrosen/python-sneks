  answers:
  - |-
    The body of a `for` loop will have one statement for each element of the
    iteration list.
  - '`for` Loops and Functions are basically the same thing'
  - |-
    The Iteration Variable will take on each value of the List Variable, one at a
    time.
  - |-
    `for` Loops always execute the body four times, which is where they get their
    name.
  - |-
    Like an `if` statement and a Function Call, the `for` Loop might cause the
    execution to not follow the order of lines.

    Trace the values of this code. If a variable is not yet defined, put an "X"
    (without quotes).

    ```python

    grades = [10, 20]
    total = 0
    for grade in grades:
        adjusted = grade + 10
        total = total + adjusted

    ```

    step | line | grades | grade | adjusted | total  
    ---|---|---|---|---|---  
    1 | 1 | [10,20] | X | X | X  
    2 | 2 | [10,20] | [grade2] | X | [total2]  
    3 | 3 | [10,20] | [grade3] | X | [total3]  
    4 | 4 | [10,20] | [grade4] | 20 | [total4]  
    5 | [line5] | [10,20] | [grade5] | [adjusted5] | [total5]  
    6 | [line6] | [grades6] | [grade6] | [adjusted6] | [total6]  
    7 | [line7] | [10,20] | [grade7] | [adjusted7] | [total7]
