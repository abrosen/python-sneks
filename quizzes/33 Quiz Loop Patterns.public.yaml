    After the third iteration of the loop, what is the value of `sum`?

    ```python

    sum = 0
    values = [4, 2, 6]
    for value in values:
        sum = sum + value

    ```

    What does line 4 do?

    ```python

    count = 0
    values = [4,5,6]
    for value in values:
        count = count + 1

    ```

    Takes the current value of `count`, adds 1 to it, and then updates `count`
    with the new value.
  - |-
    Causes an error, because it is algebraically impossible for a number to be one
    more than itself.
  - Increases `count` by the `value`.
  - Adds `1` to the list of `values`.

    Which pattern does this code most resemble?

    ```python

    lowest = 100
    grades = [90, 64, 72, 50]
    for grade in grades:
        if lowest > grade:
            lowest = grade
    print(lowest)

    any = False
    for condition in conditions:
        any = any or condition

    True or false: the following code prints `True`. You can see this code execute
    [here](https://goo.gl/axAGX7).

    ```python

    names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Carol"]
    joined_names = ", ".join(names)
    added_names = ""
    for name in names:
        added_names = added_names + name + ", "
    print(added_names == joined_names)

    ```
