    Assume that a dictionary variable has been initialized with the inventory of a
    supermarket (with the rest of the items typed out):

    ```python

    inventory = {"Apples": 50, "Bananas": 35, "Cauliflower": 0, ..., "Zucchini": 72}

    ```

    The following algorithms all attempt to perform the same task of checking how
    many "Zucchini" will be in stock. Which of the correct algorithms do you
    expect to be the fastest?
