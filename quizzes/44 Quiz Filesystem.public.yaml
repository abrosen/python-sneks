  question_type: multiple_answers_question
  question_text: Why should you tend to use forward slashes in Python?
  points_possible: 1.0
  answers:
  - |-
    Back slashes in string literals represent escape characters, which can mess up
    the path.
  - Back slashes are backwards, which means that only backwards people use them.
  - Forward slashes look prettier to everyone.
  - Forward slashes tend to work in both Mac and Windows.
