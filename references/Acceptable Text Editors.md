Most professional programmers have a text editor that they use when editing
code, even if they are also using an Integrated Development Environment like
Spyder. This editor is not only useful for previewing files across multiple
programming languages (e.g., PY files for Python, Java files for Java, CPP
files for C++), but also useful for opening data files.

We do not require a specific text editor in this course. However, you are
required to have at least one of the following. If you would like to use a
different editor, you can ask on the Piazza. Note that built-in editors like
Notepad and Wordpad (or even worse, editors like Word or Google Docs) are
completely unacceptable.

You should make sure that this program is the default, registered application
for the .py file type.
