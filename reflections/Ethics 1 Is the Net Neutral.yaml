  Consider this ethical scenario involving computing:

  _Your internet provider, Verizicast Cable, has recently announced a new
  pricing plan to make them more competitive in your area. From now on, users
  who frequently access video-heavy websites like Netflix and Youtube will be
  charged higher rates than users who typically access non-video heavy websites
  (e.g., Wikipedia, Twitter). Do you believe that this new pricing model is
  ethical?_

  Respond to this scenario by 1) summarizing the situation, 2) taking a clear
  stance, 3) writing a coherent argument supporting your stance, 4) referencing
  a relevant ethical theory or guideline, and 5) writing with understandable
  spelling, grammar, and punctuation. Refer to the [Ethics Activity
  Guide](https://vt.instructure.com/courses/66476/pages/ethics-activity-guide
  "Ethics Activity Guide" ) and the attached rubric for more information and
  examples.

  Your posts should be between 150 and 300 words. Conciseness is important in
  communicating with colleagues. Instructors will reject posts that fall outside
  of this range. Use URLs (which do not contribute to the limit) to provide
  external information and examples; do not plagiarize!

  You should use established ethical theories and guidelines; do not invent your
  own theory. Refer to the following sites for examples of ethical theories and
  guidelines:

    * [Ethical Guidelines](http://www.acm.org/about-acm/acm-code-of-ethics-and-professional-conduct)
