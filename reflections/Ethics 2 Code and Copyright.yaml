  Consider this ethical scenario involving computing:

  _While solving a tricky problem at work, you realize that you have created a
  new compression algorithm that will revolutionize computing. After showing
  your boss, she excitedly announces that this will save the company millions
  and that you will enjoy a huge bonus this year. But first, they need to
  copyright your algorithm so that no one else can ever use it without paying
  the company. Anyone who writes a similar program, even non-profits or
  hospitals (without paying the company thousands of dollars) will be sued. Will
  you agree to have your code copyrighted?_

  Respond to this scenario by 1) summarizing the situation, 2) taking a clear
  stance, 3) writing a coherent argument supporting your stance, 4) referencing
  a relevant ethical theory or guideline, and 5) writing with understandable
  spelling, grammar, and punctuation. Refer to the [Ethics Activity
  Guide](https://vt.instructure.com/courses/66476/pages/ethics-activity-guide
  "Ethics Activity Guide" ) and the attached rubric for more information and
  examples.

  Your posts should be between 150 and 300 words. Conciseness is important in
  communicating with colleagues. Instructors will reject posts that fall outside
  of this range. Use URLs (which do not contribute to the limit) to provide
  external information and examples; do not plagiarize!

  You should use established ethical theories and guidelines; do not invent your
  own theory. Refer to the following sites for examples of ethical theories and
  guidelines:
