  Consider this ethical scenario involving computing:

  _You recently attended a music festival and had a fantastic time. When you get
  home, you find that the festival organizers have uploaded photos, some of
  which include you. Unfortunately, you notice that, in one photo, you are
  apparently drinking. Because you are Facebook friends with other employees of
  your company, you do not want them to see this photo. You attempt to contact
  the organizers, but they feel that they are not responsible for taking down
  the photo. Chagrined, you instead contact Facebook to have the photo taken
  down. What should Facebook do?_

  Respond to this scenario by 1) summarizing the situation, 2) taking a clear
  stance, 3) writing a coherent argument supporting your stance, 4) referencing
  a relevant ethical theory or guideline, and 5) writing with understandable
  spelling, grammar, and punctuation. Refer to the [Ethics Activity
  Guide](https://vt.instructure.com/courses/66476/pages/ethics-activity-guide
  "Ethics Activity Guide" ) and the attached rubric for more information and
  examples.

  Your posts should be between 150 and 300 words. Conciseness is important in
  communicating with colleagues. Instructors will reject posts that fall outside
  of this range. Use URLs (which do not contribute to the limit) to provide
  external information and examples; do not plagiarize!

  You should use established ethical theories and guidelines; do not invent your
  own theory. Refer to the following sites for examples of ethical theories and
  guidelines:
