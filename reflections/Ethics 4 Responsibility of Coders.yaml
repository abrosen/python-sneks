  Consider this ethical scenario involving computing, based on a [true story
  (Links to an external site.)Links to an external
  site.](http://hackaday.com/2015/10/26/killed-by-a-machine-the-therac-25/){:
  .external}:

  _Your team finished a major software project last month, and you are on
  vacation enjoying some well-deserved time off. The new software powers a
  medical machine that should save many lives. However, you are horrified to
  read today's news, which reveals that dozens of deaths have been directly
  caused by the new machines. Experts suggest that the machine's mistakes might
  be because of a glitch in the software that your team wrote, and the families
  of the deceased are going to be suing you and the other members of your team.
  Do you believe they should be entitled to do so?_

  Respond to this scenario by 1) summarizing the situation, 2) taking a clear
  stance, 3) writing a coherent argument supporting your stance, 4) referencing
  a relevant ethical theory or guideline, and 5) writing with understandable
  spelling, grammar, and punctuation. Refer to the [Ethics Activity
  Guide](https://vt.instructure.com/courses/66476/pages/ethics-activity-guide
  "Ethics Activity Guide" ) and the attached rubric for more information and
  examples.

  Your posts should be between 150 and 300 words. Conciseness is important in
  communicating with colleagues. Instructors will reject posts that fall outside
  of this range. Use URLs (which do not contribute to the limit) to provide
  external information and examples; do not plagiarize!

  You should use established ethical theories and guidelines; do not invent your
  own theory. Refer to the following sites for examples of ethical theories and
  guidelines:
