In this lesson, you will learn about how to create variables by using
assignment statements, and then read and use those variables in your programs.

###  &icon-check-plus; Objectives

  1. Write a program that creates/reads/updates variables
  2. Identify valid and invalid names in python
  3. Identify the type of a variable
  4. Differentiate between algebraic variables and programming variables
  5. Write an assignment that involves literal values
  6. Write an assignment that involves variables
  7. Write an assignment that involves expressions
  8. Write an assignment that updates a variable

**Slide 1 - Variables:**  
Let's learn about Variables.

**Slide 2 - Purpose:**  
Variables let us store and load information. In other words, we can "read"
from and "write to" a variable with data. This lets us use data later.

**Slide 3 - Metaphor:**  
You can think of a variable as a box that holds data. That data could be a
number, a string, or any type of data. After the data is put in, we can take
it out later.

**Slide 4 - Variables vs. Data:**  
Anywhere that you use literal data, you can replace it with a variable.

**Slide 5 - Different from Math:**  
Variables in computing are very different from variables in math. In math, a
variable is an unknown that we are solving for. In computing, we always know
the value of a variable, but we are manipulating it. A variable varies over
time, but according to instructions that the programmer has written.

**Slide 6 - Names:**  
Variables are defined by their name. Names are absolutely crucial in
programming, and choosing them is an art. Names are best when they are
accurate, meaningful, and concise. We use good variable names to communicate
clearly; not just with other programmers, but with ourselves as we try to
figure out code that we have written. Of course, computers do not understand
variable names

**Slide 7 - Naming Rules:**  
There are two rules for naming variables: Names can only have letters,
numbers, and underscores. Names must begin with a letter or underscore

###  &icon-flag; Summary

Variables store values so that they can be used later in the program.
Variables are created and updated using assignment statements.
