In this lesson, you learn about how to manipulate lists. Lists have many
similarities to strings, except that they are mutable - they can be changed in
place.

###  &icon-check-plus; Objectives

  1. Subscript an element from a list
  2. Subscript a slice within a list
  3. Explain the nature of zero-based indexing
  4. Append an element to a list

**Slide 1 - List OPERATIONs:**  
Let's learn about List Operations.

**Slide 2 - Doing Stuff with Lists:**  
Once we have data inside of a list, we can do stuff with it. There are
actually many, many operations you can do on a list, so we'll learn about a
few of them here.

**Slide 3 - Indexing a List:**  
Much like strings, you can use square brackets to access a specific element of
the list. Notice that the syntax is the same, including the fact that we start
counting from zero. Do not be confused by the square brackets here - when they
are first, they are list creation. When they are second, they are list
indexing.

**Slide 4 - Subscripting a List:**  
Much like strings, you can use a colon and square brackets to access a range
of elements from a list. The rules are the same as for strings: the first
number is the starting index, and the second element is the ending index.

**Slide 5 - List Membership:**  
Much like strings, you can ask if a list has a specific value in it. The "in"
operator has a list on the right, and then any kind of value or variable on
the left. There is also a "not in" operator.

**Slide 6 - Appending to a List:**  
You cannot add elements to a list using the + operator. Instead, you must call
a method of the list, called "append". The word "Append" means "add to the
end". Append lets you add one thing to the end of the list.

**Slide 7 - Pop from a List:**  
You can also remove one thing from the end of the list using the "pop" method.
You will not need to do this too often in this course, because removing things
from list can actually be a little tricky.

###  &icon-flag; Summary

You can use several different operations on a list, and lists have methods so
they can be manipulated.
