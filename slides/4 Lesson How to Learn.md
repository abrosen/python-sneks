**Slide 1 - Learning:**  
Let's learn about Learning.

**Slide 2 - Learning to Program Can Be Hard:**  
Some people think that learning to program is frustrating. We've designed this
course to not be frustrating, but sometimes it will be. Learning a new subject
can be hard. However, keeping a few things in mind may help with this.

**Slide 3 - The Alleged "Geek Gene":**  
One of the biggest misconceptions about computing is that some people can
learn it and some people can't. There is plenty of evidence against this idea,
but it persists. Some people may take more time than others, but that's true
of anything.

**Slide 4 - Good Attitude:**  
So what determines if you'll be good at programming? A lot of evidence
suggests that it comes down to having a good attitude. Believe that you can
learn the material, given time and practice.

**Slide 5 - Mastery learning:**  
Keep trying until you get it. Never say, "I failed on the first attempt, so I
can't do it."

**Slide 6 - Getting Help:**  
If you've spent an hour on a problem and have made no progress, then GET HELP.
Ask the instructor, ask a TA, ask a friend. Get help from SOMEONE.

**Slide 7 - Working Early, Briefly, and Often:**  
The absolute best way to do well in this course is to get started on work as
soon as it is assigned. Do not work for long periods of time. Instead, work in
short consistent bursts. Scheduling 1-2 hours every day to work on this
material is much better than doing it all the night it is due.
