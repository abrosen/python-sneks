In this lesson, we will learn about a professional tool named "Jupyter
Notebooks". There are many ways to share the results of programs, and Jupyter
Notebooks are one such method.

**Slide 1 - Jupyter:**  
Let's learn about Jupyter Notebooks

**Slide 2 - Data Science:**  
Data Science is a profession that combines Computer Science, Statistics, and
many other disciplines to answer questions about the world. Data Scientists
use data and programming to answer real questions. Python is a popular
language for Data Science because there are many tools available to make that
task easier. Jupter Notebooks are one such tool.

**Slide 3 - What Are :**  
A Jupyter Notebook is a document that can combine text, code, and the output
of code all into one place. Data Scientists use Jupyter Notebooks to share the
results of their analysis in such a way that colleagues can review the results
and the process.

**Slide 4 - Launching:**  
Jupyter is easily installed as part of the Anaconda distribution of Python.
Either by searching for the " Jupyter Notebook" application on your computer,
or using the Anaconda Navigator, you can easily launch Jupyter .

**Slide 5 - Navigating:**  
Once Jupyter finishes loading, a new browser window will appear. This window
represents a folder on your computer that will store your Jupyter Notebooks.
You can choose any existing notebooks, which you may not have yet, by clicking
on any files with a " ipynb " extension. You may see other files and folders
there, but you can ignore them.

**Slide 6 - Creating:**  
To create a new Notebook, click the "New" button in the top right, and then
choose the "Python [ conda root]" option from the "Notebooks" heading. A new
window will open with your freshly created Notebook ready to be edited.

**Slide 7 - Cells:**  
A Jupyter Notebook is a series of "Cells". New cells can be created by
clicking the "+" button in the top-left. Each cell can contain either Code or
Markdown. The type of a cell can be controlled by the drop-down menu in the
middle of the top toolbar.

**Slide 8 - Code:**  
Code cells allow you to enter lines of Python code. When you have finished
editing the code, you can click the "Run" button in the toolbar. The code will
then be evaluated, and any output will be placed directly below the cell.

**Slide 9 - Markdown:**  
Markdown is a way of writing text that will add formatting. This formatting is
similar to what you would find in a document editor like Word or Google Docs.
For instance, if you put asterixis around a word, it will be italicized. If
you put a hash symbol at the beginning of a line, it will become a section
header. For more information about writing Markdown, you can check out the
documentation in the link provided.

**Slide 10 - Downloading:**  
Once you have created your Notebook, you can share it with others by
downoading it. In the top right, click the "File" menu and hover over the
"Download as" option. Two useful ways of downloading the Notebook are as
"Notebook (.ipynb)" and "HTML (.html)". The Notebook file is the source file
of the document, while the HTML file is shareable with non-programmers.

optional!

###  &icon-flag; Summary

Jupyter Notebooks are a convenient way to combine code, text, and the results
of your program into a single document. This document can then be easily
shared with others.
