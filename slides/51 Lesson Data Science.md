In this lesson, you will learn about Data Science, an emerging field that sits
at the intersection of Computing, Statistics, and many domain specific fields.
Using scientific methods, we can learn more about the world by exploring data.

**Slide 1 - Data Science:**  
Let's learn about Data Science.

**Slide 2 - Data Science:**  
As previously mentioned, Data Scientists use data and programming to answer
real-world questions. Although different from the field of Computer Science,
there are many overlaps in the skillsets needed. Both careers are extremely
popular right now, and it is valuable to learn both.

**Slide 3 - Workflow:**  
The diagram shown here models one way to conduct a Data Science analysis. In
general, data is collected from the real world, and then processed into a
suitable format. The data scientist then iteratively explores the dataset,
refining it further, and developing research questions. They answer these
questions by creating plots, running statistical analyses, and making models
from the data. The results that they gather are reported back to interested
stakeholders, who make decisions that affect the world. Of course, in
practice, each data scientist develops their own process, but this model is
well-regarded.

**Slide 4 - Non-linear Workflow:**  
Data scientists rarely work straight from beginning to end. Although the
workflow shown may suggest an orderly sequence of events, the reality is that
data scientists move from phase to phase as needed. Sometimes, you need to
revise your questions after you find your first answers. Other times, you
realize you need a different dataset in order to answer your questions

**Slide 5 - Telling a Story:**  
In many ways, a good scientist becomes a good storyteller. You are collecting
data and analyzing it in order to tell a story. We very rarely learn universal
truths, but are instead building up evidence to support a particular
hypothesis. Keep your audience in mind, and the story that you ultimately want
to tell.

**Slide 6 - Finding Data:**  
We simultaneously live in a data-rich world and a data-poor world. More and
more processes and systems, both human and computational, create data.
However, this data is often kept under lock and key to protect individuals,
corporations, or governments. Further, many potential sources of data are not
collected for pragmatic reasons. You may find that you want a particular
dataset, but cannot get access to it. Other times, you will be given a tidal
wave of data and you will struggle to deal with the scale.

**Slide 7 - A Tidal Wave of Data:**  
More and more data is available in the world each day. This tidal wave of data
has led to the term "Big Data", which can refer to data is high in volume,
changes rapidly, or has a very complex structure. Of course, the amusing
secret is that most data is not big, but that does not mean these smaller
datasets are not useful. You may eventually learn computational techniques to
process big data, but for now you should still appreciate the power of small
datasets.

**Slide 8 - Advanced Data Science:**  
There are many topics in Data Science that we do not have time to cover.
Although it can be tricky to learn how to use advanced techniques in areas
like Machine Learning, you might be surprised by what you can accomplish. You
are encouraged to continue learning more about these advanced techniques and
tools. For now, focus on the basics: making questions and building answers
using basic data processing.
